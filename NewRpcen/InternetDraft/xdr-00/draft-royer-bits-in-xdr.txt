                              Bits in XDR
                       draft-royer-bits-in-xdr-00

Abstract

   This is an extension to the XDR specification to allow for bits to be
   described and sent.

   With protocols that have a large number of boolean values the
   existing standard requires each to be individually packed into a
   32-bit value.

   This does not alter any XDR data streams that would effect existing
   implementations.

   *  This specification describes how to pack a bit-boolean and short
      bit-width data values into the 32-bit XDR block size.

   *  And this specification describes how to describe them by extending
      "The XDR Language Specification" to include bits.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Packing Bits

   This specification has two objectives.

   *  Boolean value packing.

   *  Small value packing.
