    <abstract>
      <t>
				This is an extension to the XDR specification to allow
				for bits to be described and sent.
			</t>
			<t>
				With protocols that have a large number of boolean values
				the existing standard requires each to be individually
				packed into a 32-bit value.
			</t>
			<t>
				This addition does not alter any XDR data streams or
				effect existing implementations.
			</t>
			<ul>
				<li>
					This specification describes how to pack a bit-boolean and
					short bit-width data values into the 32-bit XDR block size.
				</li>
				<li>
					And this specification describes how to describe them
					by extending "The XDR Language Specification" to include
					bits.

			<t>
				Definitions:
			</t>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<t>
						A value with 2 to 31 bits is called a bit-value.
						In order for it to be a bit-value, it must be
						less than 32-bits in width as a 32-bit
						value are processed as described in RFC-XDR.
					</t>
					<t>
						A bit-value value can be signed or unsigned.
						They often represent a set of possible conditions
						and not a numeric value and would be unsigned.
						And in other usages, the bits could represent a positive or
						negative value.
					</t>
				</li>
				<li>
					A single bit value is called a bit-boolean.
					A bit-boolean is a single bit in a 32-bit value.
					A bit-boolean by itself has no sign.
					Up to 32 bit-booleans fit in a 32-bit XDR block.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<t>
			</t>
			<t>
				All multi bit width values are placed into network byte
				order the same as their 32-bit or wider values
				as described in RFC-XDR.
			</t>
			<t>
				The bits are packed into a 32-bit block with the
				first bits included taking the least significant position.
				And later included bits taking position up to the
				most significant position.
