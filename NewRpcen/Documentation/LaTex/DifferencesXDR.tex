\section{XDR Differences from RFC-4506}
\subsection{Place 'struct' Outside of 'union'}
Currently RPCGEN++ does not allow structs to be defined in unions.
Define them out side of the union, and then use them.

For example, this is valid as defined in RFC-4506:
\input{StructInUnion}

Currently, with RPCGEN++, you will need to define your
structure outside of the union as shown in this example:
\input{StructOutsideUnion}

\subsection{RPCGEN++ has support for bit XDR fields}
The \textit{bitfield} objects are useful when you have boolean or other
values that do not need to have their own 32-bit storage.
Or they could represent the bit values needed to interface
with hardware.

They are declared by appending a colon (:) and a decimal number
after the data type or variable name.
They are defined using the \textit{bitfield} data type.
In this example, \textit{TwoFourBitValues} is declared
as 8-bits in size, and it contains two 4-bit values.
\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
bitfield TwoFourBitValues:8 {
   int8_t:4 MyVariableName:4;
   int8_t:4 TheOtherFourBits:4;
};
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Two Four Bit values in one 8-bit value}
\label{fig:A32BitExampleXDR}
\end{figure}

The number of bits inside of the \textit{bitfiled} must be equal to or
less than the number of bits declared in the bitfield name.

You must declare them with the least significant bits first.
\textit{MyVariableName} in the example would be placed in
bit positions 0-3 and \textit{TheOtherFourBits} would occupy
bit position 4-7.

\textit{For signed values}, make sure that the value you pass
into the encoding call is correctly signed for the bit
width you specified in the XDR file.
If you specify a 4-bit value as signed
and pass it in as an 8-bit signed value, the sign bit will not
be encoded.

The \textit{bitfield} values can be signed or unsigned and
are XDR encoded and XDR decoded on their own.
Once encoded the \textit{bitfield} itself is sent as
opaque data.

In this example, the \textit{bitfield} is 64-bits and
contains multiple values that are not byte aligned:
\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
bitfield ALargeOne:64 {
   int8_t:1 DeviceEnabled:1;     /* 'A' */
   int8_t:2 DeviceMode:2;        /* 'B' */
   int8_t:4 DeviceRotation:4;    /* 'C' */
   int8_t:4 DeviceStatus:4;      /* 'D' */
   int32_t:32 DevicePosition:32; /* 'E' */
};
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Packed 64-bit device example}
\label{fig:ALargeOneXDR}
\end{figure}
The upper 21 bits are undefined in this example,
and are set to zero (0) in this
implementation.
XDR and this implementation sends data in chunks of 32-bits.
The 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E' comments in figure
\ref{fig:ALargeOneXDR} are represented as the bits in
the 64-bit figure \ref{fig:ALargeOneBitsXDR}.
\begin{itemize}
\item 'A' is one bit wide.
\item 'B' is two bits wide.
\item 'C' is four bits wide.
\item 'D' is four bits wide.
\item 'E' is 32 bits wide.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
  \includesvg{64bitBitField.svg}
  \caption{64-bit 'ALargeOne' bitfield}
  \label{fig:ALargeOneBitsXDR}
\end{figure}

RPCGEN++ does not impose a size limit on the bit width.
This is an example of a 192-bits object.

\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
bitfield A192BitOne:192 {
  ... define up to 192 bits ...
};
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Packed 192-bit device example}

\end{figure}
