\section{Test Coverage}\label{sec:TestCoverage}
This project uses \textit{gcov} and \textit{gcovr} to generate the HTML
test coverage results.

This produces a lot of data and this section will get you
started in understanting what you have produced.

Once the program or library is compiled with the test coverage
tools, you must run them on the target operating system.
So the Windows 64-bit builds (W64) must be run on a windows
computer to get the test results for windows.
And same with the Android devices.
