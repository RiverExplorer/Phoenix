  \underline{\textbf{THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS}}
  
  RPCGEN++ is an Open Source XDR and ABNF processor and code generator.
  RPCGEN++ can read \href{https://ietf.org}{IETF} data description
  formats;
  \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4506}{[RFC-4506]}
  XDR and \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5234}{[RFC-5234]}
  ABNF input files and produce runnable code for Linux, Windows,
  and Android. The resulting code has also been tested on the Android
  Oculus virtual reality headset.

  The code generated can connect systems across the internet,
  or your intranet.
  RPCGEN++ takes care of encoding, transferring, decoding and over
  TLS. This RPCGEN++ processor can also create the client and server side
  prototypes where you fill in the details of your design.
  RPCGEN++ also allows for describing bit field data for XDR and ABNF.
  
  The XDR side of the implementation was inspired by the ONC
  rpcgen program written by Sun Microsystems
  in the 1990's.
  This version has extensions that allow for C++ like, classes, class
  methods, and comments to be in included into the (.x) source XDR
  description files. RPCGEN++ was written using the antlr4 protocol
  compiler. It produces C++ code, and has been designed to be able
  to create other languages.

  The ABNF code is from scratch and allows the user to annotate
  the ABNF with instructions about the intent of the structure
  of the intended program.
  
  RPCGEN++ was originally written to support the Phoenix project.
  Its source is part of the Phoenix project.
  (\href{https://github.com/RiverExplorer/Phoenix}{Phoenix Open Source Project})
  RPCGEN++ and Phoenix are both Open Source.
