		<dt>ADMIN_CMD</dt>
		<dd>
			Administrative and auditing operations.
			These allow for authorized users to configure, query logs, errors,
			and possibly user activity.
		</dd>
		<dt>AUTH_CMD</dt>
		<dd>
			Authentication and authorization operations.
			These operations authenticate users and verity their authorization
			access.
		</dd>
		<dt>CMD</dt>
		<dd>
			A protocol operation.
			They are broken down into, ADMIN_CMD, AUTH_CMD, FILE_CMD, and PROTO_CMD.
		</dd>
    <dt>Command</dt>
    <dd>
			Each packet contains a command.
			This command is also in the reply to the command.
			Not all commands have a reply.
			These are called a CMD.
		</dd>
		<dt>FILE_CMD</dt>
		<dd>
			File and folder operations.
			This include creating, getting, modifying, deleting, moving,
			and renaming files.
		</dd>
    <dt>Media Type</dt>
    <dd>
			Each MIME object has a media type that identifies the
			content of the object.
			This specification does not add, remove, or alter any MIME media type;
		</dd>
    <dt>MIME</dt>
    <dd>
			This protocol transports MIME objects.
			This specification does not remove or alter any MIME objects;
		</dd>
    <dt>Parameter</dt>
    <dd>
			Most CMD have values that are associated with it.
			These are called parameters.
			For example, the create folder CMD has the name of the new
			folder to be created as a parameter.
			
			When the parameter itself has values, then these CMD parameters
			are called PROTO_CMD, because they have their own protocol.
		</dd>
    <dt>PROTO_CMD</dt>
    <dd>
			Specific protocols may have commands specific to their needs.
			These are calls a PROTO_CMD.
			An example might be extracting a specific attachment type and
			its data out of a MIME object.
			This could be a PROTO_CMD parameter to the FILE_CMD.
		</dd>
    <dt>XDR</dt>
    <dd>
			RFC-4506 specifies a standard and compatible way to transfer
			binary information.
			This protocol uses XDR to transmit the CMDs and replies.
			The MIME data is transported as XDR opaque, as in unmodified.
