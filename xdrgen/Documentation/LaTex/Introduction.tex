\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can process RFC-4506 compliant files.
\item Can process RFC-5234 compliant files.
\item Generates C++ code and header files.
\item Designed to be able to produce for other output languages.
\item Preserves comments in the .x files.
\item Preserves comments in the .abnf files.
\item Allows for class member functions.
\item Extends RFC-4506 to include bit fields.
\item Extends RFC-5234 to include bit fields.
\item Generates ABNF definitions per RFC-5234 from RFC-4506 files.
\end{itemize}

The basic XDR process is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Edit an XDR definition file (.x file).
\item Run 'rpcgen++' on the file.
\item Compile the results.
\end{enumerate}

And the basic ABNF process is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Edit an ABNF definition file (.abnf file).
\item Run 'rpcgen++' on the file.
\item Compile the results.
\end{enumerate}
