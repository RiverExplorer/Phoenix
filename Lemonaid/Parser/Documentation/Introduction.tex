\section{Introduction}
This is the documentation for the 'Protocol' command.
It reads user written protocol definition files and
create compilable code that can transmit and receive
the data over the Internet.

The protocol definition file is a text file that is editable
with any text editor.

Inside the definition file are directives and data definitions.
The directive aid the generation and over the wire format of the
described data definitions.

The sample implementation generates protocols for NATIVE (no
byte swaping), CBOR, JSON, REST, XDR, and XML client and servers.

In addition it can generate C++ and C\# code implementing those
protocol generators.

\textbf{NOTE: It is possible that specific implementations allow
  each endpoint to act as a client and server.
  For the purposes of this specification, the client is
  the one that is originating actions and expects
  results or replies from the other endpoint}.

This model support both threaded and non threaded
implementations.
For non-threaded systems the data is processed serially
or however the implementation handles both incoming
and outgoing data.
The data flow is the same for both threaded and non threaded
implementations.
This model is the core of both the client and server.
