\section{Main Thread}\label{sec:MainThread}
The client main thread might be controlled by a user, with
a user interface.
And a client program could exist that automates the
transfer of mime objects without human intervention.

A server is mostly responsive to commands from the client.

Once the main thread has gathered the MIME information to
be transmitted to the server, it takes these basic steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assigns the command (CMD). Commands are defined
  in \ref{todo}.
  
\item Then creates an I/O Vector Packet (\ref{fig:IovPacket}).
  And creates one IO vector Blob for each section of data
  that is part of the command, it appends that Blob object
  to the \_Q member variable in the order needed by CMD.

\item Puts a temporary lock on the output queue \textit{OQ})
  
\item Pushes the new I/O Vector Packet onto the
  end of \textit{OQ}.

\item Removes the temporary lock on the output queue.
  
\end{enumerate}
