\section{Introduction}
The client and the server send data to the network, and get
data from the network.
This \mbox{input/output} model (IO Model) works with
both the Phoenix client and Phoenix server.

\textbf{NOTE: It is possible that specific implementations allow
  each endpoint to act as a client and server.
  For the purposes of this specification, the client is
  the one that is originating actions and expects
  results or replies from the other endpoint}.

This model support both threaded and non threaded
implementations.
For non-threaded systems the data is processed serially
or however the implementation handles both incoming
and outgoing data.
The data flow is the same for both threaded and non threaded
implementations.
This model is the core of both the client and server.
