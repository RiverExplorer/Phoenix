\section{Dispatch Thread}\label{sec:DispatchThread}
The dispatch thread awaits data from the other
endpoint and dispatches the implementation code
based on the command and sequence number.

It waits for data to be deposited in the \textit{IQ}.
When data arrives, it:

\begin{enumerate}

\item It places a temporary lock on \textit{IQ}.
  
\item Pulls one I/O Vector Packet out of \textit{IQ}.

\item Removes the a temporary lock on \textit{IQ}.

\item Examines the command (CMD) and sequence number (SEQ\_t).
  When a client gets an even sequence number, it is a command
  reply from the server and dispatches the command
  specific actions.

  When a client gets an odd sequence number, it is a
  command from the server.
  These types of commands are status messages of some
  kind. Perhaps notifying the client the server is shutting down
  and logging out the user. Or other server commands
  specified in the specification \ref{TODO}.
  The dispatch thread calls the appropriate methods to handle
  the server command.

  When a server gets an even sequence number, it is a command
  from the client and dispatches the implementation
  code based on the CMD.

  When a server gets an odd sequence number, it is a
  reply from the client. None are defined at this time.

\end{enumerate}
