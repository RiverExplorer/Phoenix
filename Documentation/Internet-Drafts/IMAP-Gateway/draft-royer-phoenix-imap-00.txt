1.  Introduction

   IMAP may be the most popular email fetching protocol in the world.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IMAP Commands

2.1.  IMAP and Phoenix Commands

   This table summarizes the IMAP and the Phoenix equivalent command

   NOTE: Phoenix is a binary protocol, so the symbolic names are shown,
   not their numerical value.

   +===========+===============+=======================================+
   | IMAP      | Phoenix       | Breif Comment                         |
   +===========+===============+=======================================+
   | LOGIN     | AUTH          | The IMAP LOGIN command has exact      |
   |           |               | equivalents in Phoenix.               |
   +-----------+---------------+---------------------------------------+
   | STARTTLS  |               | Phoenix is only transmitted over a    |
   |           |               | secure connection, so it has no       |
   |           |               | need for a STARTTLS command.          |

   | LIST      | FOLDER_LIST   | The FOLDER_LIST can list the          |
   |           |               | entire hierarchy, or the details      |
   |           |               | of a folder, or message, or all.      |
   |           |               |                                       |
   |           |               | The FOLDER_LIST command with no       |
   |           |               | parameters in Phoenix returns the     |
   |           |               | hierarchy of folders from the         |
   |           |               | root.  Plus it provides some          |
   |           |               | information about each folder.        |
   |           |               |                                       |
   |           |               | The FOLDER_LIST command can also      |
   |           |               | add a parameter that returns index    |
   |           |               | information about each message,       |
   |           |               | including, the status and size,       |
   |           |               | and other information.  This can      |
   |           |               | be done for the entire tree, or       |
   |           |               | specific folders.                     |
   |           |               |                                       |
   |           |               | This associated folder and message    |
   |           |               | data is called meta information in    |
   |           |               | Phoenix.                              |
   |           |               |                                       |
   |           |               | In addition, the FOLDER_LIST can      |
   |           |               | add a parameter that is a set of      |
   |           |               | header names that it wants back       |
   |           |               | for each message (perhaps Subject,    |
   |           |               | From, ...) So the client can get      |
   |           |               | back the entire hierarchy of          |
   |           |               | folders, and sufficiet message        |
   |           |               | information to display its initial    |
   |           |               | information to a user.  All in one    |
