Abstract

   NOTE: This is just getting started, not ready for submission yet.

   Email and MIME messages account for one the largest volumes of data
   on the internet.  The transfer of these MIME message has not had a
   major updated in decades.  Part of the reason is that it is very
   important data and altering it takes a great deal of care and
   planning.

   This application transport can also transfer non-MIME data.  It can
   be used as an XDR transport, or for opaue data (blobs of known or
   unknown data) transport.

   Another major concern is security and authentication.  This proposal
   allows for existing autnentication to continue to work.

   This is a MIME message transport that can facilitate the transfer of
   any kind of MIME message.  Including email, calendaring, and text,
   image, or multimedia MIME messages.  It can transfer multipart and
   simple MIME messages.

   The POP and IMAP protocols are overly chatty and now that the
   Internet can handle 8-bit transfers, there is no need for the overly
   complex text handling of messages.

   This proposal includes a sample implementation.
   (https://github.com/RiverExplorer/Phoenix) Which also includes a
   gateway from this proposal to existing system.  Thunderbid and
   Outlook plugins are part of the sample implementation.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   On the Internet, just about everything is a MIME object and there are
   many ways to transport MIME.  This document specifies a new
   application level MIME transport mechanism and protocol.  This
   document does not specify any new or changed MIME types.

   Transporting MIME objects is generally done in one of two ways: (1)
   Broadcasting, (2) Polling.  Both methods often require some form of
   authentication, registration, and selecting of the desired material.
   These selection processes are essentially a form of remote folder
   management.  In some cases you can only select what is provided, and
   in others you have some or a lot of control over the remote folders.

   In addition to other functions, this specification defines a remote
   and local folder management.  This remote folder management is common
   with many type of very popular protocols.  This design started by
   looking at the very popular IMAP and POP protocols.

   An additional task is transporting the perhaps very large MIME
   objects.  Some MIME objects are so large that some devices may
   default to looking at only at parts of the MIME object.  An example

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again         January 2025


   is an email message with one or more very large attachments, where
   the device may default to not download the large attachment without a
   specific request from the user.

   Some objects are transported as blocks of data with a known and fixed
   size.  These are often transported with some kind of search, get, and
   put commands.  In effect these are folder and file commands

   Other MIME objects are transported in streams of data with an
   unspecified size, such as streaming music, audio, or video.  This
   specification describes how to use existing protocols to facilitate
   the data streaming.  And again, these are folder and file commands.

   A MIME object can be a simple object, or it may contain many
   multipart sections of small to huge size.  These sections can be
   viewed as files in the containing MIME object.

   By implementing this specification application developers can use the
   techniques to manage local and remote files and folders.  Remote
   email or files are the same thing in this specification.  The
   sections of MIME object with multipart sections are viewed as files
   in the MIME object.  You can interact with the entire folder, or just
   the files within it.

   MIME objects have meta data, and they are called headers.  Files and
   folders have meta data, and they are called file attributes.  This
   specification does not mandate any meta data, it allows for a
   consistent transport of existing meta data.

   File and folder meta data is a complex task that can involve access
   control lists and permissions.  This specification defines a
   mechanism to transport this meta data, it does not define the meta
   data.

   And this specification provides for the ability to define both
   protocol extensions and the creating of finer control for specific
   commands that may evolve over time.

   This examples compares current folder and file manipulations to how
   it can be used in this protocol with email.

   *  You can search for file names.  You can search email for: sender,
      subject, and more.

   *  You can search for file contents.  You can search for email
      message contents.

   *  You can create, delete, and modify files.  You can create, delete,
      and modify email messages.

   *  You can create, delete, and modify folders.  You can create,
      delete, and modify email folders.

   What this specification defines:

   *  How to use existing authentication implementations or use new
      ones.

   *  This specification describes a standard way to perform file
      operations that are remote to the application and agnostic to
      purpose of data being transported.

   *  Specifies a way to migrate from some existing protocols to
      Phoenix.  Provides links to sample implementations.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terms and Definition used in this proposal

   The following is a list of terms with their definitions as used in
   this specification.

   AdminCmd
      A general term for any administrative command.  Administrative and
      auditing operations.  This list includes commands for authorized
      users to configure, query logs, errors, possibly user activity.

   AuthCmd
      A general term for any authentication command.  Authentication and
      authorization operations.  These operations authenticate users and
      verity their authorization access.

   CMD
      A specific protocol operation, or command.  They are broken down
      into, AdminCmd, AuthCmd, FileCmd, and ProtoCmd.

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again         January 2025


   Command, CMD
      Each packet contains a command.  This command is also in the reply
      to the command.  Not all commands have a reply.  These are called
      a CMD or command.

   FileCmd
      A general term for any file command.  File and folder operations.
      This include creating, getting, modifying, deleting, moving, and
      renaming files.

   Media Type
      Each MIME object has a media type that identifies the content of
      the object.  This specification does not add, remove, or alter any
      MIME media type;

   MIME
      This protocol transports MIME objects.  This specification does
      not remove or alter any MIME objects;

   Packet
      A packet is a blob of data that has a header (its length) followed
      by a Phoenix command with all of its values and parameters.
      Packets flow in both directions and asynchronously.  Commands can
      be sent while still waiting for other replies.  Each endpoint may
      send commands to the other endpoint without having to be prompted
      to send information.

   Parameter
      Most commands have values that are associated with them.  These
      values are called parameters.  For example, the create folder
      command has the name of the new folder to be created as a
      parameter.

   ProtoCmd
      A general term for all protocol commands.  This also includes
      commands that do not fall into one of the other catagories
      described here in this definistions section.

   SEQ, Command Sequence, CMD_SEQ
      Each command has a unique identifier, a sequence number.  All
      replies to a command include the same sequence number as the
      original command.  In this way replies can be matched up with
      their original command.

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again         January 2025


   SSL
      For the purpose of this specification, SSL is interchangable with
      TLS.  This document uses the term TLS.  The sample implementation
      uses both SSL and TLS because the legacy UNIX, Linux, Windows, and
      OpenSSL code uses the term SSL as well as TLS.

   TLS
      A way of securely transporting data over the Internet.  See RFC-
      xxxx.

   XDR
      RFC-4506 specifies a standard and compatible way to transfer
      binary information.  This protocol uses XDR to transmit a command,
      its values and any parameters and replies.  The MIME data, the
      payload, is transported as XDR opaque, and is unmodified.

3.  Commands Summary

   The endpoint that initiates the connection is called the client.  The
   endpoint that is connected to, is called the server.  The client is
   the protocol authority, and the server responds to client commands as
   configured or instructed by the client.

   This section provides an overview of the basic commands.  Each
   command has a detailed section in this specification.

   When a command is sent to the remote endpoint and received, the
   remote endpoint determines if the connection is authenticated or
   authorized to perform the command.  If not supported, or not
   authorized, a NotSupported command is send as a reply.  The
   NotSupported command sent back has the same Sequence number that was
   in the original command.

   Many commands are only valid after authentication.

   When the client connects to a server it immediately sends its pre
   authentication capabilities to the server.  Or an Auth command.

   When the server gets a new connection followed by a pre
   authentication capability command, it immediately sends its pre
   authentication capabilities to the client.

   When the client and server have had a relationship, the client may
   send an Auth Command to initiate the authorization and does not send
   its pre authentication capability list to the server.  It then waits
   for the Auth reply from the server.

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again         January 2025


   *  If the client gets an Auth reply that is positive, it sends its
      post authentication capability list to the server.

   *  If the client gets an Auth reply that is negative, it sends its
      pre authentication capability list to the server.

   When a servers first received packet is a Auth command, It processes
   the Auth command and sends the Auth reply.

   *  If the Auth reply is positive, then it also sends it post
      authentication capability list.

   *  If the Auth reply is negative, then it sends its pre
      authentication capability list to the client.

   A server may automatically send its pre authentication capability
   list to the client upon initial connection.  Or it may wait to see if
   it gets a pre authentication capability list, or an Auth command.

   If the client sends an Auth command as its first packet, it may get
   the pre authentication capability from the server before the Auth
   reply.  Simply process both.

3.1.  Protocol Commands Summary

   In addition to the protocols listed in this specification.
   Additional protocols and commands can be added in the future.  They
   must follow the same framework listed here.

   This protocol connects two endpoints over a network and facilitates
   the secure and authorized transfer of MIME objects.

   This is a binary protocol.  The payload can be anything, text or
   binary.  This protocol was designed to reduce the number of back and
   forth requests and replies between the client and server.  By using
   XDR as the format for transferring binary control information it is
   portable to any computer architecture.  Appendix XXX has the rpcgen
   definition for the protocol defined in this specification.

   After the connection is successful and authenticated, ether endpoint
   may send commands to the other endpoint.  When the server initiates
   an unsolicited command, it could be a any kind of notification or
   message for the client side application or the user.  It could be
   reporting errors or updates to previous client initiated commands.

   All commands initiated from the client have even numbered command
   sequence numbers.  All commands initiated from the server have odd
   numbered command sequence numbers.

   Some commands expect a command reply.  Other commands do not expect a
   command reply.  An example of a command that expects a reply is the
   ping command.  An example of a command that does not expect a reply
   is the keep-alive command.  Conceptually there are two kinds of
   commands:

   Directive commands:  A directive type command expects the other
      endpoint to process the command and possibly reply with some
      results.  An example could be: Send me an index of my emails in my
      InBox.  The client would expect a result.  Another example is a
      bye command, once sent, no reply is expected.

   Request commands:  A request type command may or might not have any
      reply.  For example, a keep-alive command is a request to not
      timeout and has no reply.  And a send new email notifications
      command would expect zero or more replies and it would not require
      them, as they might not happen.

   These are not specific protocol entities, these concepts will be used
   to describe the expected behavior when one of these are transmitted.

3.1.1.  Packet Summary

   All commands are sent in a packet.  A packet has two parts:

   1.  The packet header.

   2.  The packet body.

   The packet header has one value, the total length of the packet body,
   and payload sent as an unsigned 64-bit integer in network byte order.
   The length does not include its own length.  It is the total length
   that follows the length value.

   The packet body is divided into three parts:

   1.  Command sequence (SEQ).

   2.  The Command (CMD).

   3.  The command specific data (Payload).

3.1.1.1.  Command Sequence Number (SEQ)

   The Command SEQ is a 32-bit unsigned integer sent in network byte
   order.  This SEQ is an even number when initiated from the client,
   and an odd number when initiated from the server.




Royer                     Expires 25 July 2025                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again         January 2025


   The first SEQ value sent from the client is zero (0) and is
   incremented by two each time.

   The first SEQ value sent from the server is one (1) and is
   incremented by two each time.

   In the event an endpoint command SEQ reaches its maximum value, then
   its numbering starts over at zero (0) for the client and one (1) for
   the server.  An implementation must keep track of outstanding
   commands and not accidentally re-issue the same SEQ that may still
   get replies from the other endpoint.

3.1.1.2.  The Command (CMD)

   The command is a predefined enumerated 32-bit unsigned integer sent
   in network byte order.  The value (in hex) 0xFFFFFFFF is reserved for
   extensions if the 32-bit range is exhausted.

3.1.1.3.  The Payload (Payload)

   The payload has no predefined length, other what what is specified
   for the CMD in the packet.  It could be zero to vary large in size.
   It could be opaque data, or it could be data that is XDR encoded.
   The contents are specific to the CMD specified in the in the packet
   body.

3.1.2.  Packet Reply Summary

   All replies to a command are also a command packet.  They contain the
   same command SEQ and command as the original packet.  The endpoint
   recognizes it is a reply because:

   *  The command SEQ matches one that is waiting a reply.

   *  When the client gets an even numbered SEQ, it can only be a reply.

   *  When the server gets an odd numbered SEQ, it can only be a reply.

   Some commands have zero to many replies.  Each of these multiple
   replies contains the same SEQ as the original command.  An example,
   the client sends a request to be notified when new email arrives and
   uses command SEQ 20.  Each time a new email arrives, a reply will be
   sent from the server with a command SEQ of 20.  And over time, the
   client may get many with a SEQ of 20 as new emails arrive on the
   server.

3.2.  Administration Commands Summary

   Implementations are not required to implement any ADMIN command.  A
   client will know the server supports one or more ADMIN commands when
   it gets its post authentication capability command from the server.

   Administrative command can be used to configure, audit, and manage
   the remote endpoint.  Administrative command can be used to
   configure, audit, and manage user access.

3.2.1.  Administration Capability Definitions

   Implementations MUST NOT send the ADMIN capability in the pre
   authorization CAPABILITY list.

   Implementations that support any administration command MAY include
   ADMIN capability in the post authentication CAPABILITY list.  An
   implementation may decide that only specified and authorized users
   may issue administrative commands and send only those authenticated
   users the ADMIN capability.

   The ADMIN capability include the list of ADMIN commands the user is
   allowed to perform.  For example, if a user only has permission to
   only view user lists, then only the USER_LIST ADMIN capability will
   be provided.

   The capability name is also the command name to use when invoking
   that capability.

   When a user attempts to send a commmand they are not authorized to
   send, the remote endpoint will reply with a NotSupported command with
   its sequence number set to the sequence number from offending
   command.

3.2.2.  Administration of users.

   The following operations are defined for administration.

3.8.  KeepAlive Command Summary

   The KeepAlive command is sent to the server from the client.  It
   requests the server not time out.  The server may honor or ignore the
   request.

   The Phoenix protocol is designed to transfer data and a server may
   handle a small subsets of what is possible.  Which is why the server
   decides what is an important command while determining idle timeout.




Royer                     Expires 25 July 2025                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again         January 2025


   When the server sends the post authentication capabilities to the
   client, it includes an IdleTimeout capability that includes the
   number of seconds it allows for idle time.  If no significant action
   has been taken by the client, as determined by the server, in that
   time the server may timeout and close the connection.

   The KeepAlive command tells the server that the client wishes the
   server not to time out as long as a KeepAlive or other command is
   sent to the server before IdleTimeout seconds have passed.

   An IdleTimeout capability can be a positive number, zero, or a
   negative number.

   *  A positive number is the maximum idle time in seconds before the
      server terminates the connection.

   *  When the IdleTimeout is zero (0), the server does not timeout.

   *  When the IdleTimeout is less than zero (< 0), it means it ignores
      KeepAlive and it will idle out in the absolute value of the
      IdleTimeout value in seconds.  For example, a value of (-300)
      means it will ignore KeepAlive and timeout when the server
      determines nothing significant has happened in 5 minutes (300
      seconds).

   Servers that are not threaded or can not reply to simultaneous or
   overlapping commands, MUST set their IdleTimeout to zero (0) or a
   negative number.

   Clients MUST NOT send KeepAlive commands to a server that has an
   IdleTimeout of zero (0) or negative (< 0).

   Clients MUST NOT send KeepAlive commands to the server until at least
   75% of the idle time has passed since the last command has been sent
   to the server.

   A server may terminate a connection if the server implementation
   determines that KeepAlive commands are arriving to quickly.

3.9.  Ping Command Summary

   The ping command only sent when the client implementation has
   determined it has waited too long for a command reply.  The ping
   command is only initiated from the client.  It is not valid for the
   server to send a ping command to a client.

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again         January 2025


   The ping command MUST NOT be the first command sent to the server.
   It should only be sent when the client implementation determines it
   has waited too long for a reply.

   If the server supports the ping command, then a PING capability is
   sent in the pre authentication capability command.

   Sometimes servers are unavailable and can go down.  A server could be
   down for maintenance, or in a shutdown mode.  It might limit the
   number of simultaneous connections.  It might be very busy.  The
   packets might not be making it to the server because of network
   issues.

   When a ping command is received by the server:

   *  When the server did not send PING capability to the client.  Then
      the server replies with a NotSupported packet with the sequence
      number the same as in the ping command.

   *  When the server has not yet received an authentication command,
      the server replies with a NotSupported packet with the sequence
      number the same as in the ping command.

   *  When the server has received an authentication command, and has
      not yet replied to an authentication command.  Then the server
      sends a ping reply, with the same sequence number that was in the
      ping command.  This could happen when the client implementation
      had determined it has waited too long for an authentication reply.

   *  When the client is authenticated, and when the server is available
      for processing commands.  Then the server replies with a ping
      reply with the same sequence number.  This could happen when the
      client implementation had determined it has waited too long for an
      expected reply.

   If the server is alive and not available, the server will reply with
   a NotSupported command, with its sequence number set to the sequence
   number in the ping command.

   If a connected and authenticated client has been waiting for a reply
   or for some other reason needs to determine if the server is still
   available.  It can send a ping command.  If the server is still
   available, it sends a ping reply.  If it is no longer available for
   any reason, it sends a NotSupported reply.

   Endpoints MUST NOT send a ping command if they are awaiting the
   results of a previously sent ping command.

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again         January 2025


   Endpoints MUST NOT send more than two ping commands per minute.

   Clients and servers must give priority to ping commands.  If
   possible, reply as soon as it receives the command.

   The server MAY consider too many ping commands as a malfunctioning or
   malicious client and terminate the connection.

   Servers that are not threaded or can not reply to simultaneous or
   overlapping commands, MUST NOT include PING in their capability
   command.

3.10.  S/MIME Commands Summary

4.  Over the Wire Protocol Detail

   This section specifies the details of what is transmitted over the
   network.

   All protocol data transmitted between the endpoints is sent in
   network byte order.

   All payload data transmitted between the endpoints is sent in
   original format.  The payload consent is seen as an opaque blob of
   data within a command packet.

   When a command packet is received by ether endpoint it: (1) Checks
   the command sequence number to determine if it is a reply or not.
   (2) If it is a reply, it looks at the command and dispatches it to
   the implementations commands reply code.  (3) If is not a reply, it
   looks at the command and dispatches it to the implementations command
   code.

   A command and all of its replies, use the same format as described
   here.

   A packet has a 64-bit unsigned integer in network byte order that is
   set to the octet count of all of the data that follows this length
   value.  The shortest packet is 16 octets in size, with a length value
   set to 8.  With 8 octets for the length, and 8 octets for the packet.

   Followed by a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order that is
   the command sequence number.

   Followed by a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order that is
   the command.

   Followed by zero or more octets of payload data.

   There is no space, padding, or line endings between the parts of the
   packet.  The payload is sent without any modification and is not
   encoded or transformed in any way.  A packet is shown here vertically
   only to aid in readability.

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ...64-bit.unsigned.integer.length ..............................|
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ...32-bit.unsigned.command.SEQ...|
   +----------------------------------+
   | ...32-bit.unsigned.command.CMD...|
   +----------------------------------+
   | payload.....

   The payload size and format varies for each command.  The details of
   the payload content, and the format of that content, is described in
   each specific CMD section.

   An implementation can send, receive, and dispatch packets within its
   implementation by looking at the length, SEQ, and CMD, then passing
   the payload to code that can handle that payload.

   - Read in a 64-bit value.  - Convert the value from network byte
   order, to host byte order.  This is the total length of the data that
   follows.  - Read in length octets into the packet payload.  - Get the
   32-bit value in the payload, it is the SEQ in network byte order.  -
   Convert the SEQ from network byte order, to host byte order.  - Get
   another 32-bit value in the payload, it is the CMD in network byte
   order.  - Convert the CMD from network byte order, to host byte
   order.  - Dispatch the CMD with SEQ and all of the data that follows
   to implementation

   The following is pseudo code that explains how processing incoming
   XDR data can be handled:

     // Where:
     //  uint64_t, is a 64-bit unsigned integer.
     //  uint32_t, is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
     //  uint8_t *, is a pointer to 8-bit data.
     //  XDR, is an XDR object.
     //
     //  CmdPacket, is an object that represents all commands
     //  and replies.
     //
     //  NOTE: See the sample implementation.
     //
     uint64_t   NetLength;
     uint64_t   PacketLength;

   The values for the commands are arbitrary and were assigned as
   created.  There is no plan or origination to the numbers.  There is
   no priority or superiority to any value.  The table is sorted by
   name, not value.

   The values are not unique.  They are only unique within the context
   in which they are used.

   Some of these values are reused for other commands.  For example
   USER_CREATE is both an (a) AUTH capability reply informing the user
   that they have permission to create a user with the (b) USER_CREATE
   command.

   Some values may be reused if they are parameter arguments to other
   commands.  For example xxxxxx.
