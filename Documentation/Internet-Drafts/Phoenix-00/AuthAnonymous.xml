			When true, it means that anonymous login is supported.
			When false, it means that anonymous login is not supported.

			The highest bit is set to zero (0) which indicates

		<t>
			Once the connection is made the client sends its CAPABILITY_PRE
			list, or an authentication to the server..
		</t>
		<t>
			If the client has already had a relationship with the server,
			then the client may send the AUTHANONYMOUS command to the server.
			And only if AUTHANONYMOUS	had been successful in the past, to that same server.
		</t>
		<t>
			If the server does not support (or no longer supports) an AUTHANONYMOUS
			command, it will reply with a CAPABILITY_PRE packet with
			the same sequence number the same as in the AUTHANONYMOUS login request.
			And include the authorized authentication methods.
		</t>
		<t>
			After the server receives an AUTHANONYMOUS, and if it supports it,
			it allows the connection and considers the user a valid
			anonymous user.
			Then the server replies with a CAPABILITY_POST command.
			When the client gets the CAPABILITY_POST command, it knows
			the AUTHANONYMOUS was successful.
			The client may then send any CAPABILITY_POST items to the server.
