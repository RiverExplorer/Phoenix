	<t>
		Phoenix is a binary protocol.
		Each value is sent as an unsigned 32-bit integer in xdr format.
	</t>
	<t>
		The values for the commands are arbitrary and were assigned
		as created. There is no plan or origination to the numbers.
		There is no priority or superiority to any value.
		The table is sorted by name, not value.
	</t>
	<t>
		The values are not unique. They are only unique within the context
		in which they are used.
	</t>
	<t>
		Some of these values are reused for other commands.
		For example USER_CREATE is both an (a) AUTH capability reply
		informing the user that they have permission to create a
		user with the (b) USER_CREATE command.
	</t>
	<t>
		Some values may be reused if they are parameter arguments
		to other commands.
		For example xxxxxx.
