<t>
	All protocol data transmitted between the endpoints is sent in
	network byte order.
</t>
<t>
	All payload data transmitted between the endpoints is sent
	in original format.
	The payload consent is seen as an opaque blob of data within
	a command packet.
</t>
<t>
	When a command packet is received by ether endpoint it:
	(1) Checks the command sequence number to determine if it is a reply
	or not.
	(2) If it is a reply, it looks at the command and dispatches
	it to the implementations commands reply code.
	(3) If is not a reply, it looks at the command and dispatches
	it to the implementations command code.
</t>
<t>
	A packet has a 64-bit unsigned integer in network byte
	order that is set to the octet count of all of the
	data that follows this length value.
	The shortest packet is 16 octets in size, with
	a length value set to 8. With 8 octets for the length, and 8 octest
	for the packet.
</t>
<t>
	Followed by a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte
	order that is the command sequence number.
</t>
<t>
	Followed by a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte
	order that is the command.
</t>
<t>
	Followed by zero or more octets of payload data.
</t>
<t>
	There is no space, padding, or line endings between the parts
	of the packet.
	The payload is sent without any modification and is not
	encoded or transformed in any way.
	It is shown here vertically only to aid in readability.
