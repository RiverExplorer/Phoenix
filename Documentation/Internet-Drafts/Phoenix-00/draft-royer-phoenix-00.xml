      <name>Terms and Definition used in this proposal</name>
      <t>
				The following is a list of terms with their definitions as
				used in this specification.
			</t>
      <xi:include href="Definitions.xml"/>
    </section>

		<section anchor="COMMANDS">
			<name>Commands Summary</name>
			<t>
				The endpoint that initiates the connection is called the client.
        The endpoint that is connected to, is called the server.
        The client is the protocol authority, and the server responds
        to client commands as configured or instructed by the client.
      </t>

			<t>
				This section provides an overview of the basic commands.
				Each command has a detailed section in this specification.
			</t>
			<t>
				When a command is sent to the remote endpoint and received,
				the remote endpoint determines if the connection is authenticated
				or authorized to perform the command.
				If not supported, or not authorized, a NotSupported command
				is send as a reply.
				The NotSupported command sent back has the same Sequence number 
				that was in the original command.
			</t>
			<t>
				Many commands are only valid after authentication.
			</t>
			<t>
				When the client connects to a server it immediately sends
				its pre authentication capabilities to the server.
				Or an Auth command.
			</t>
			<t>
				When the server gets a new connection followed by
				a pre authentication capability command, it immediately sends
				its pre authentication capabilities to the client.
			</t>
			<t>
				When the client and server have had a relationship, the
				client may send an Auth Command to initiate the authorization
				and does not send its pre authentication capability list
				to the server.
				It then waits for the Auth reply from the server.
			</t>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If the client gets an Auth reply that is positive,
					it sends its post authentication capability list to the server.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the client gets an Auth reply that is negative,
					it sends its pre authentication
					capability list to the server.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<t>
				When a servers first received packet is a Auth command,
				It processes the Auth command and sends the Auth reply.
			</t>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If the Auth reply is positive, then it also sends it
					post authentication capability list.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the Auth reply is negative, then it sends its
					pre authentication capability list to the client.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<t>
				A server may automatically send its pre authentication
				capability list to the client upon initial connection.
				Or it may wait to see if it gets a pre authentication
				capability list, or an Auth command.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the client sends an Auth command as its first packet,
				it may get the pre authentication capability from the server
				before the Auth reply. Simply process both.
