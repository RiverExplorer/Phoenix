	<t>
		Get information from the server about its implementation logs.
		All log information is related to the server implementation.
	</t>
	<t>
		A SERVER_LOGS ADMIN CMD is sent with two time range values.
		The time values are a UTC object.
		The first is the start time, and the second is the end time.
	</t>
	<t>
		When the start time is zero, it means start from the beginning
		of the logs.
	</t>
	<t>
		When the end time is zero, up to now.
	</t>
	<t>
		There are three categories of information and four
		request types.
	</t>

					implementation thinks may be worth recording, and is
					not an error.
