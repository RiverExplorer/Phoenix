	Email and MIME messages account for one the largest volumes
	of data on the internet.
	The transfer of these MIME message has not had a major updated in decades.
	Part of the reason is that it is very important data and altering it
	takes a great deal of care and planning.
	This application transport can also transfer non-MIME data.

	Security and authentication are always a serious issue
	with protocolls.
	This proposal allows for legacy authentication mechanisms
	to work, in some cases unaltered.
</t>
<t>
	This is a MIME message transport that can facilitate
	the transfer of any kind of MIME message. Including email, calendaring,
	and text, image, or multimedia MIME messages.
	It can transfer multipart and simple MIME objects..
</t>
<t>
	The POP and IMAP protocols are overly chatty and now that the Internet
	can handle 8-bit transfers, there is no need for the overly complex
	text handling of messages.
</t>
<t>
	This proposal includes a sample implementation.
	(<eref target="https://github.com/RiverExplorer/Phoenix">Github - Phoenix</eref>)
	Which also includes a gateway from this proposal to existing systems.
	Thunderbird and Outlook plugins are part of the sample implementation.
	A Linux, Windows DLL and .NET, and Android client library are part of
	the sample implementation
