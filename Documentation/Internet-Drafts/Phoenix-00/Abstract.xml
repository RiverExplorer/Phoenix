	Email and MIME messages account for one the largest volumes of data on the
	internet.
	The transfer of these MIME message has not had a major updated in decades.
	Part of the reason is that it is very important data and altering it
	takes a great deal of care and planning.
</t>
<t>
	This application transport can also transfer non-MIME data.
	It can be used as an XDR transport, or for opaue data (blobs of
	known or unknown data) transport.
</t>
<t>
	Another major concern is security and authentication.
	This proposal allows for existing autnentication to continue to work.
</t>
<t>
	This is a MIME message transport that can facilitate
	the transfer of any kind of MIME message. Including email, calendaring,
	and text, image, or multimedia MIME messages.
	It can transfer multipart and simple MIME messages.
</t>
<t>
	The POP and IMAP protocols are overly chatty and now that the Internet
	can handle 8-bit transfers, there is no need for the overly complex
	text handling of messages.
</t>
<t>
	This proposal includes a sample implementation.
	Which also includes a gateway from this proposal to existing system.
	Thunderbid and Outlook plugins are part of the sample implementation.
