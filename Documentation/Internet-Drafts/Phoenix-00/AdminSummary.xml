	<t>
		Implementations are not required to implement any ADMIN command.
		A client will know the server supports one or more ADMIN
		commands when it gets its post authentication capability command
		from the server.

		Administrative command can be used to configure, audit, and manage

		<name>Administration Capability Definitions</name>
		<t>
			Implementations MUST NOT send the ADMIN capability
			in the pre authorization CAPABILITY list.
		</t>
		<t>
			Implementations that support any administration command
			MAY include ADMIN capability in the post authentication CAPABILITY list.
			An implementation may decide that only specified and
			authorized users may issue administrative commands and
			send only those authenticated users the ADMIN capability.
		</t>
		<t>
			The ADMIN capability includes the list of ADMIN commands the user is
			allowed to perform.
			For example, if a user only has permission to only view user lists, then
			only the USER_LIST ADMIN capability will be provided.
		</t>
		<t>
			The capability name is also the command name to use
			when invoking that capability.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a user attempts to send a commmand they are not authorized
			to send, the remote endpoint will reply with a NotSupported command
			with its sequence number set to the sequence number from offending
			command.
