	<name>Command - VENDOR_ID</name>
	<t>
		When sent, the VENDOR_ID command is accompanied
		by a string.
		This string is unique and defined by the server implementation
		or instance.
	</t>
	<t>
		When a server gets a VENDOR_ID command, it compares
		it to what it expects.
		When they match, then after the user is authenticated
		the server can then determine if it will send 
		the SERVER_CONFIGURE capability to the client.
	</t>
	<t>
		It would be expected that any client sending its VENDOR_ID
		command to the server is expecting the possibility
		of receiving a SERVER_CONFIGURE capability back.
	</t>
	<t>
		The purpose of the VENDOR_ID command and its value
		is to help ensure that any SERVER_CONFIGURE commands
		are compatible between the client and server.
	</t>
	<t>
		Over the life of the connection, the VENDOR_ID command
		and value can change and would need to be sent again.
		It might update the value after authentication.
		Or after some action has been performed.
	</t>
	<t>
		For example, a server may perform one set of vendor specific operations
		during working hours, and a different set after hours.
		It may or might not also send an additional CAPABILITY_PRE command
		as account permissions change.
