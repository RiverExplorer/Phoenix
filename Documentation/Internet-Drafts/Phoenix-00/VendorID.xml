	<name>Capability - VENDOR_ID</name>
	<t>
		When sent, the VENDOR_ID capability is accompanied
		by a string.
		This string is unique and defined by the server implementation
		or instance.
	</t>
	<t>
		When a server gets a VENDOR_ID capability, it compares
		it to what it expects.
		When they match, then after the user is authenticated
		the server can then determine if it will send 
		the SERVER_CONFIGURE capability to the client.
	</t>
	<t>
		It would be expected that any client sending its VENDOR_ID
		capability to the server is expecting the possibility
		of receiving a SERVER_CONFIGURE capability back.
	</t>
	<t>
		The purpose of the VENDOR_ID capability and its value
		is to help ensure that any SERVER_CONFIGURE commands
		are compatible between the client and server.
