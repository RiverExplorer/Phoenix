	<name>Authentication Commands Summary</name>
	<t>
		The first thing a client must do, is authenticate
		with the server.
	</t>
	<t>
		Some users may also be administrators.
		In those cases the user and client may wish to do further
		authentication steps.
		A user may wish to temporarily step up their authentication
		level to perform some operations, then step back down
		to do their personal operations.
		This would be done on separate connection.
	</t>
	<t>
		A server may if it wishes include AUTH capabilities in
		the CAPABILITY_POST command.
		It can decide which authenticated users can or must use
		additional authentication.
	</t>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Some user accounts can be user only, without administrative
			abilities of any kind.
			Their CAPABILITY_POST list will not include any administrative
			capabilities.
		</li>
		<li>
			Some user accounts can be administrative only, and are limited
			to CAPABILITY_POST actions that only include administrative
			capabilities.
		</li>
		<li>
			Some user accounts can be a normal user, with the ability
			to step up their account to be able to do administrative actions.
			While in stepped up mode, they are not able to act as their
			original user account.
			These users will get one or more administrative capabilities in
			their CAPABILITY_POST list.
		</li>
		<li>
			And some user account can be allowed all operations.
			This protocol does not limit users.
			This protocol enables user permissions to be configured.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<section>
		<name>Authentication process</name>
		<t>
			The client initiates the authentication process.
			When the client makes a connection to a server it
			takes one of two paths, depending
			on [<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (A)]:
		</t>
		<ul>
			<li>
				If it has never authenticated to this server using the
				current account.[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (L)]:
			</li>
			<li>
				If its last connection had a successful authentication
				to this server using the current account.
				[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (B)]:
			</li>
		</ul>
		<t>
			Part of the authentication process is determining which
			authentication process a server requires.
			So upon initial connection the client sends a CAPABILITY_PRE
			packet that includes all of the authentication methods
			it is willing to use.
			It is an ordered list with the more desirable ones at
			the front of the list, and the least desirable ones
			at the end if the list.
			And if the client wishes to do any vendor specific operations,
			then it must also	include the VENDOR_ID string in the
			initial packet.
		</t>
		<t>
			Similarly, the CAPABILITY_PRE packet sent from the server
			includes the same information.
			The server is the authentication mechanism authority.
		</t>
		<t>
			When a client sends a VENDOR_ID command in
			its CAPABILITY_PRE command, then the server MUST
			reply back in its CAPABILITY_PRE reply,
			its VENDOR_ID (It is valid for it to be empty).
			(See <xref target="VendorID">VendorID</xref>)

		<name>Authenticating With Successful History</name>
		<t>
			When a client has had a successful connection to the server
			using the current client login name, then the client
			sends the AUTH command and appends as a second
			command in the same packet, the clients CAPABILITY_PRE command
			as shown in <xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (B &amp; C).
			Then the client waits for a server reply at
			<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (I):
		</t>
		<t>
			When the server gets this dual command packet
			<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> at (D) and attempts the
			authentication process.
			If the authentication passes,[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (E)]:
			the server sends a	CAPABILITY_POST
			[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (G)]
			command to the client as the okay reply.
		</t>
		<t>
			If the authentication fails, then the server sends
			the client its first CAPABILITY_PRE command.
			[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (F)]
		</t>
		<t>
			The client waits for a reply from the server
			at <xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (I).
		</t>
		<t>
			When the client gets a CAPABILITY_PRE
			[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (F)]
			it knows the authentication failed, so the client
			goes to start a normal authentication
			process [<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (K) &amp; (Q)]
		</t>
		<t>
			If the received command was a CAPABILITY_POST
			[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (G)], then
			the authentication passed and the client
			is authenticated.
			And starts any post authentication work.
			[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (J &amp; Y)]
		</t>

		<name>Authenticating With No History</name>
		<t>
			When there is not successful history between
			the client and server, the authentication
			process starts at 
			[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (M)]
			with the client sending its CAPABILITY_PRE
			command to the server.
			Then waits for a server reply
			[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (O)]
		</t>
		<t>
			As soon as the server gets its
			authentication CAPABILITY_PRE at
			[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (N)],
			the server evaluates the contents of
			the CAPABILITY_PRE from the client,
			matches it to the servers configured
			ability, and sends a CAPABILITY_PRE
			packet back to the client.
			[<xref target="AuthSummary01"/> (P)]
			This CAPABILITY_PRE packet contains
			the authentication method(s) that the
			client must use to authenticate with
			the server.
			A CAPABILITY_PRE command from the
			server is only sent after receiving
			one from the client.
			So the server only sends the common
			authentication method using a priority
			configured into the server.
		</t>
		<t>
			The servers CAPABILITY_PRE command
			may contain zero or more authentication
			methods.
			When more than one, all must be used.
			For example, the server could require
			a client certificate (AUTHCERT_TLS),
			and a user MD5 login (AUTHMD5).
			So both would be sent back, in this example.
			When the servers CAPABILITY_PRE command
			does not have any authentication methods,
			the server is telling the client that no
			authentication is possible.
			When this happens the server then terminates
			the connection.
			And the client then terminates the connection.
		</t>

	</section>

	<section>
		<name>Authentication Failure</name>
		<t>
			If the authentication fails, then the server replies
			back with a CAPABILITY_PRE with the sequence
			number the same as in the authentication request.
			And includes the supported authentication methods.
		</t>
		<t>
			After too many retries, the client or server may terminate the connection.
