	<name>Administration - USER_KICK_USER</name>
	<t>
		There can be only one user per connection.
		So the USER_KICK_USER ADMIN command has no data associated with it.
		When this ADMIN CMD is received by a client, it is being informed
		that the user is logged out and may not or may be able to login again.
	</t>
	<t>
		No specifics are given because the possible reasons are nearly
		unlimited and locale dependent.
		Any notifications the server may elect to provide 
		is out of scope in this specification.
		The user may have to contact the service provider for details.
	</t>
	<t>
		A SERVER_KICK_USER is only sent from the server to the client.
		If a server gets a SERVER_KICK_USER from a client, the
		server replies with a NotSupported with the sequence
		number the same as the invalid command.
	</t>
	<t>
		There is no reply to a SERVER_KICK_USER.
		The client is no longer authenticated.
		The server may allow the client to re-authenticate, or
		the server may terminate the connection.
	</t>
	<t>
		If the server allows the client to re-authenticate, the server
		next sends a CAPABILITY_PRE to the client
	</t>
	<t>
		If the server is terminating the connection, the server then
		sends a SERVER_SHUTDOWN to the client.
	</t>
	<t>
		The server may elect to send both packet sets in
		one packet to the server.
