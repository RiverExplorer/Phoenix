		Just about everything transported on the net is a MIME object
		and there are	many ways to transport them.
		This document specifies a new application level MIME transport
		mechanism	and protocol.
		This is an attempt to unity the transfer protocol of MIME and other
		objects.
	</t>
	<t>
		Transporting objects is generally done in one of two ways:
		(1) Broadcasting or pushing and (2) Polling.
		Both methods often require some form of authentication, registration,
		and selecting of the desired material.
		These selection processes are essentially some form of remote
		folder management to request or find material.
		In some cases you can only select what is provided, and in others
		you have some level of control over the remote material.
	</t>
	<t>
		In addition to other functions, this specification defines
		a folder management protocol.
		This remote folder management is common with many type of very popular
		protocols, all do it a different way.
		This design started by looking at the very popular IMAP
		and POP protocols.
	</t>
	<t>
		An additional consideration is transporting the perhaps very
		large objects.
		Some MIME objects are so large that the default for
		many devices is to not download the without a specific
		user request.
		Some large object can be downloaded and can be useful
		in pieces, other object types will need to be fully downloaded.
	</t>
	<t>
		Some objects are transported as blocks of data with a known and
		fixed size.
		These are often transported with some kind of search, get, and
		put commands.
		In effect these are folder and file commands
	</t>
	<t>	
		Other MIME objects are transported in streams of data with
		an unspecified size,	such as streaming music, audio, or video.
		This specification describes how to use existing protocols to 
		facilitate the data streaming.
		And again, these are basically folder and file commands.
	</t>
	<t>
		A MIME object can be a simple object, or it may contain many multipart
		sections of small to huge size.
		These sections can be viewed as files in the MIME object.
	</t>
	<t>
		By implementing this specification application developers can
		use the techniques to manage local and remote files and folders.
		Remote email or files are the same thing in this specification.
		The sections of MIME object with multipart sections are viewed
		as files in the MIME object.
		You can interact with the entire folder, or just the files within it,
		or parts of a file.
	</t>
	<t>
		MIME objects have meta data, and they are called headers.
		Files and folders have meta data, and they are called file attributes.
		This specification does not mandate any meta data.
		This protocol allows for a consistent transport of
		basic access control information.
		You have access to read the data, or not.
		You can share the data, or not.
		You can create new remote objects, or not.
	</t>
	<t>
		File and folder meta data can be a complex task that can involve
		access control lists, group lists, and various permissions.
		This protocol is not designed to manage complex access
		control lists.
	</t>
	<t>
		The goal of this protocol is to provide a consistent
		transport mechanism.
		This is a transfer protocol to be used by applications,
		it is not a application.
		A streaming application might not implement some of the protocol.
		And an email application might not implement streaming.
	</t>
	<t>
		What this specification defines:
	</t>
	<ul>
		<li>
			How to leverage existing authentication implementations
			or use new ones.
		</li>
		<li>
			A standard way to perform file
			and folder operations	that are remote to the application and
			agnostic to purpose of data being transported.
		</li>
		<li>
			Specifies a way to migrate from some existing protocols to
			this Phoenix protocol.
			Provides links to sample implementations.
		</li>
		<li>
			A way to transport data between applications.
		</li>
	</ul>
