	<name>Administration - SERVER_CONFIGURE (0x00:8)</name>
	<t>
		Remote administration of servers is an essential feature
		in modern systems.
		An implementation that supports SERVER_CONFIGURE
		adds SERVER_CONFIGURE to the post authentication
		capability command sent from the server to the client.
		The server implementation only sends this capability
		to authenticated and authorized users.
		Users can become authorized with the
		USER_PERMISSIONS command, or by server implementation
		specific configuration methods.
		Server specific configuration methods are out of
		scope for this specification.
	</t>
	<t>
		Server specific configuration options are unique to
		each server implementation.
		This specification defines a method to set, update,
		delete, and view server configuration values.
		Implementations may extend the SERVER_CONFIGURE
		capabilities and commands.
		Such extensions must start with "X-" and followed
		by any vendor or agreed on name.
		It is suggested that server implementations send
		a post authentication implementation specific
		capability to authenticated and authorized users
		in order to identify themselves to their own client
		implementations.
		If the client does not send the correnct vendor ID information,
		then the server would not send its capability to the client.
	</t>
	<t>
		SERVER_CONFIGURE sends and receives the configuration
		information in key + value pairs.
		The key and value are each a string.
	</t>
	<t>
		Multiple SERVER_CONFIGURE commands can be sent in the
		same ADMIN packet.
