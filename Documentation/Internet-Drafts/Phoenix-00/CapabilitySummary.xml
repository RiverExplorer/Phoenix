	<name>Capability Commands Summary</name>
	<t>
		Capabilities are attributes of both a client and server
		implementation.
		Some may provide a superset or subset when compared
		to other implementations.
		And this is fine.
		This can be done to split workload or just because
		they specialize in specific operations.
	</t>
	<t>
		A capability is a 31-bit integer.
		Plus a 1-bit identifier signifying if it is a Phoenix capability
		or vendor specific capability, for a total of 32-bits.
	</t>
	<t>
		This specification describes several capabilities.
		Some are described in other sections, and some are
		described in this section.
		See appendix XREF-TODO for a complete list in this specification.
	</t>

	<t>
		Capabilities from the server arrive twice.
		Once before any user is authenticated, and one after.
	</t>
	<t>
		Capabilities from the arrive arrive once or twice.
		Once before any user is authenticated.
		And MAY send another capability set after.
	</t>
	<t>
		Table <xref target="PreAuthCap"/> lists the Pre-Authentication
		capabilities.
		Pre-Authentication capabilities are sent to the client before
		any user is authenticated.
