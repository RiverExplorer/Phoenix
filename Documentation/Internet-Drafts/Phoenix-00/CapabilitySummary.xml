	<name>Capability Commands Summary</name>
	<t>
		The purpose of this protocol is to facilitate the transfer
		of MIME objects, not to define how they are used.
		Capabilities allow each endpoint to ensure the other
		endpoint is capable of transferring the desired content
		and optionally allow control of the other endpoint.
	</t>
	<t>
		Capabilities are attributes of both a client and server
		implementation.
		Some may provide a superset or subset when compared
		to other implementations.
		This can be done to split workload or just because
		they specialize in specific operations.
	</t>
	<t>
		A capability is a 31-bit unsigned integer.
		Plus a 1-bit identifier signifying if it is a Phoenix capability
		or vendor specific capability, for a total of 32-bits.
	</t>
	<t>
		This specification describes several capabilities.
		Some are described in other sections, and some are
		described in this section.
		See the <xref target="CapabilityIndex">Capability Index</xref>
		for a complete list	in this specification.
	</t>
	<t>
		These are not a negotiation.
		Each sends their abilities to the other.
	</t>
	<t>
		Capabilities from the server are sent once or twice.
		Optionally one before the user is authenticated (CAPABILITY_PRE),
		and once after (CAPABILITY_POST).
		If a user logs out and stays connected, then the process starts
		over with the server assuming a new client just connected.
	</t>
	<t>
		Capabilities from the client may be sent, once, or twice
		per authentication process.
		The client sends a CAPABILITY_PRE with its connection to a server.
		And optionally once after the user is authenticated (CAPABILITY_POST).
	</t>
	<t>
		There is no requirement that a server provides
		an authentication method for any client.
		There is no requirement that a server provide
		any non-vendor capability for any client.
		They could be configured to only allow vendor
		specific authentication or only vendor specific commands because they
		are not servers open to the public and require
		non standard authentication methods,
		or only from clients providing a correct CAPABILITY_PRE
		value.
	</t>
	<t>
		<em>NOTE: Vendor specific capabilities MUST include a Length
		value after the capability value.
		This is because there is no way a non compatible implementation
		could calculate the length of the data that would follow it
		in order to find the next capability or command in the packet.
		</em>
	</t>

	<t>
		Table <xref target="PreAuthCap"/> lists some CAPABILITY_PRE
		capabilities.
	</t>

	<t>
		Some capabilities have data associated with them, others do not.
	</t>
	<section>
		<name>Capability - CAPABILITY_PRE</name>
		<t>
			Pre authentication capabilities are sent before authentication.
		</t>
		<t>
			When the client connects to a server it always sends a
			CAPABILITY_PRE as soon as the connection is established.
			This packet contains all of the authentication methods
			supported by the client.
			It is an ordered list with the most preferred at the start
			of the list and the lesser preferred at the end of the list.
		</t>
		<t>
			The CAPABILITY_PRE that the client sends to the server
			in this specification includes an optional VENDOR_ID.
			Vendors may add new client to server capabilities as long
			as they set the VENDOR_BIT in the command and are implemented
			to understand that not all server will understand their
			vendor specific extensions.

		<name>Capability - CAPABILITY_POST</name>
		<t>
			Table <xref target="PostAuthCap"/> lists the CAPABILITY_POST
			capabilities.
			Post-Authentication capabilities are sent to the client after a
			a user authenticates.
		</t>
		<t>
			A client or server may or might not also send an additional CAPABILITY_POST command
			as account permissions change.
		</t>
		<t>
			For example after authentication an administrator could give the
			current user more permissions.
			At that time the server would send a new CAPABILITY_POST to the client.
			Or perhaps the client needs to update the server with a new VENDOR_ID
			and CAPABILITY_POST after a license key is installed.
			Or perhaps remove capabilities after business hours.
