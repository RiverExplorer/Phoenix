	<name>Meta Data</name>
	<t>
		In this specification a file and a MIME object are used
		interchangeably.
		Meta Data is data that is associated with the MIME object
		and not contained within the MIME object.
		Meta Data should never be stored in the MIME object as altering
		the MIME object would invalidate the index information and
		can invalidate digital signature and encryption information.
	</t>
	<t>
		Meta Data for the folder and MIME objects is returned in
		a FOLDER_OPEN, FILE_OPEN, FILE_METADATA, or FOLDER_METADATA command.
		Meta Data can be set and updated by the client using FILE_METADATA
		or FOLDER_METADATA commands.
	</t>
	<t>
		Most are 8-bit boolean values that are set to false (%x00) or true (%x01).
		A value that does not exists is the same as a false.
	</t>
	<t>
		Meta data can be global to the object.
		That is once tagged (or not tagged) the attribute shows up for all
		users.
		Or it can be user specific meta data.
		User specific meta data does not show up for other users.
	</t>
	<t>
		Many have the same or similar name and meaning as they do
		in <xref target="RFC9051">IMAP</xref>.

	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Answered</name>
		<t>
			This Meta Data only applies to files.
		</t>
		<t>
			When true, the object has been replied to by the client.
			This has the same meaning as \Answered does in IMAP.
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset.
			This is user specific meta data because it
			also applies to shared folders and files.
		</t>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Attributes</name>
		<t>
			This object has been tagged with special attributes.
			It is a list of strings with matching values.
		</t>
		<t>
			User defined attributes MUST start with "X-".
			These are not portable between implementations
			and no attempt should be made to copy these
			between implementations.
		</t>
		<t>
			Non user defined attributes are described
			in other sections or specifications.
		</t>
		<t>
			This can be user specific meta data or global meta data.
			See the specific attribute documentation.
		</t>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Deleted</name>
		<t>
			When true, this object has been marked as deleted
			and has not yet been expunged.
			This has the same meaning as \Deleted does in IMAP.
		</t>
		<t>
			For shared objects, an expunge removes the
			user from shared access to the file.
			And the actual expunge is only processed
			when all shared users have expunged
			the object.
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset.
			This is user specific meta data because it
			also applies to shared folders and files.
		</t>

	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Draft</name>
		<t>
			This Meta Data only applies to files.
		</t>
		<t>
			When true, this object is incomplete and not ready.
		</t>
		<t>
			This has the same meaning as \Draft does in IMAP.
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset.
			This is user specific meta data.
		</t>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Flagged</name>
		<t>
			An object has been tagged as important.
			This is the same as the IMAP \Flagged value. 
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset.
			This is user specific meta data because it
			also applies to shared folders and files.
		</t>
	</section>

	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Forwarded</name>
		<t>
			This Meta Data only applies to files.
		</t>
		<t>

		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset.
			This is user specific meta data because it
			also applies to shared folders and files.
		</t>
	</section>

	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Hide</name>
		<t>
			With NotExpungable objects, the user may wish to not view the object.
			In these cases the attribute Hide can be set.
			The attribute does not effect the view of other users.
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset.
			This is user specific meta data because it
			also applies to shared folders and files.
		</t>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Junk</name>
		<t>
			This has the same meaning as $Junk does in IMAP.
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset.
			This is user specific meta data because it
			also applies to shared folders and files.

			When true, this MIME object can not be copied.
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset by the owner of the file or folder.
			This value can not be unset by non owners.
			This is global meta data.

		<t>
			This has the same meaning as $NotJunk does in IMAP.

			also applies to shared folders and files.
		</t>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - NotExpungable</name>
		<t>
			The mime object can not be marked for delete or expunged.
			It could be because it is an historical record that will never
			be expunged, or other reason.
		</t>
		<t>
			A client implementation could use the Hide attribute
			to not show the object to the user.
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset by the owner of the file or folder.
			This value can not be unset by non owners.
			This is global meta data.

	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Phishing</name>
		<t>
			This has the same meaning as $Phishing does in IMAP.

	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - ReadOnly</name>
		<t>
			The MIME object associated with this attribute
			can not be altered, deleted, moved, or renamed.
			It can be copied, unless the NoCopy meta tag
			is also applied.
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can be set and unset by the owner of the file or folder.
			This value can not be unset by non owners.
			This is global meta data.
		</t>
		<t>
			Setting of this to false may fail if the file or folder is
			stored on read-only media.
			When the file or folder is stored on read-only media,
			this MUST BE set to true.
		</t>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<name>Meta Data - Shared</name>
		<t>
			The MIME object associated with this attribute
			is shared and is also often tagged with the ReadOnly
			meta data tag.
		</t>
		<t>
			This value can not be set and unset by the owner.
		</t>
		<t>
			If copying of the file or folder is allowed, then
			the shared attribute is removed when copied.
		</t>
		<t>
			This file or folder will only be expunged when all
			of the users with shared access have deleted and
			expunged it.
		</t>
