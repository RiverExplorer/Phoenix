		<t>
			This specification adds some usage to <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref>
			to deal with bit width in a binary number.
		</t>
		<t>
			Terminals may specify a bit width.
			That is the number of bits in the value.
		</t>
		<t>
			<xref target="RFC5234" section="2.3">Terminal Values</xref>
			is within this specification defined to be:
		</t>
		<t>
			b = binary / binary:width
			<br/>
			<br/>
			d = decimal / decimal:width
			<br/>
			<br/>
			x = hexadecimal / hexadecimal:width
		</t>
		<t>
			Where: with is the number of bits in the value.
			And must be an unsigned integer greater than zero.
		</t>
		<t>
			And they will pack when applied to to a rule:
		</t>
		<t>
			When the left side has a width: 
			The number of bits on the left side must equal
			the number of bits on the right side.
		</t>
		<t>
			In this example A Header is 32-bits in size
			and is composed of an 8-bit and 24-bit value.
			The most significant value are placed on the left of the rule:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>
      Header:32 = Offset:8 Length:24
		</sourcecode>
		<t>
		</t>
		<t>
			The pseudo code could be:
		</t>
		<sourcecode>

      // Header is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
      // Offset is an 8-bit unsigned integer.
      // Length is a 24-bit unsigned integer
      //
      Header = Offset &lt;&lt; 24 | Length;

		</sourcecode>

		<t>
			This shifts the 8-bit Offset over 24 bits to the left, then
			adds the 24-bit Length.

			The result would be:
		</t>
