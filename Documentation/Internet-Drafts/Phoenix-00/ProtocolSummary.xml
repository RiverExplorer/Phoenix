	<name>Commands Overview - Packet and Reply</name>
	<t>
		In addition to the protocols listed in this specification.
		Additional protocols and commands can be added in the future.
		They must follow the same framework listed here.
	</t>
	<t>
		This protocol connects two endpoints over a network and facilitates
		the secure and authorized transfer of MIME and other objects.
	</t>
	<t>
		This is a binary protocol encoded using CBOR streaming.
		The payload can be anything, text or binary.
		This protocol was designed to reduce the number of back and forth
		requests and replies between the client and server.
		By using CBOR as the format for transferring binary control
		information it is portable to any computer architecture.
	</t>
	<t>
		The basic connection starts in one of two modes.
	</t>
	<ul>
		<li>
			An account is connecting to a server for the first time
			and does not know which authentication methods the
			server supports.
		</li>
		<li>
			An account has authenticated to a server in the past or the
			client is already aware of a valid authentication protocol
			to use.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<t>
		When connection is made, the server waits for a packet from
		the client.
		It will be one of two kinds.
	</t>
	<ul>
		<li>A pre authentication capability packet (CAPABILITY_PRE).</li>
		<li>An authentication packet. (AUTH...).</li>
	</ul>
	<t>
		If the first packet the server receives
		is a pre authentication capability packet,
		The server examines the clients packet and determines what
		authentication options to present to the client.
		The server then sends back its pre authentication capability packet
		which includes the supported authentication methods.
		Then the client, using the information from the server starts
		the authentication process.
		On a successful authentication, the server sends the client
		a post authentication capability packet with a new sequence number.
	</t>
	<t>
		If the first packet the server receives is any of the supported
		authentication packets, then the server processes the authentication
		packet.
		On failure to authenticate, the server sends the client a pre
		authentication capability packet with the same sequence number
		that was in the authentication attempt and includes the
		servers supported authentication methods.
		On a successful authentication, the server sends the client
		a post authentication capability packet with a new sequence number.
	</t>
	<t>
		After the connection is successful and authenticated, ether endpoint
		may send commands to the other endpoint.
		When the server initiates an unsolicited command, it could be a
		any kind of notification or message for the client side application
		or the user. It could be reporting errors or updates to
		previous client initiated commands.
	</t>
	<ul>
		<li>
			All commands initiated from the client have even
			numbered command sequence numbers.
		</li>
		<li>
			All commands initiated from the server have odd
			numbered command sequence numbers.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<t>
		Some commands expect a command reply.
		Other commands do not expect a command reply.
		An example of a command that expects a reply is the ping command.
		An example of a command that does not expect a reply is the keep-alive
		command.
		Conceptually there are two kinds of commands:
	</t>
	<dl>
		<dt>Directive commands:</dt>
		<dd>
			A directive type command expects the other endpoint to process
			the command and possibly reply with some results.
			An example could be: Send me an index of my emails in my InBox.
			The client would expect a result.
			Another example is a bye command, once sent, no reply is expected.
		</dd>
		<dt>Request commands:</dt>
		<dd>
			A request type command may or might not have any reply.
			For example, a keep-alive command is a request to not
			timeout and has no reply.
			And a send new email notifications command would expect
			zero or more replies and it would not require them, as they
			might not happen.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<t>
		These are not specific protocol entities, these concepts will
		be used to describe the expected behavior when one of these
		are transmitted.
	</t>
	<section anchor="PACKET_SUMMARY">
		<name>Packet Overview</name>
		<t>
			All commands are sent in a packet.
			A packet has two parts:
		</t>
		<ol>
			<li>The packet header.</li>
			<li>The packet body.</li>
		</ol>
		<section>
			<name>Packet Header</name>
			<t>
				The packet header has one value, the total length
				of the packet body, and payload sent as an
				CBOR unsigned integer.
				The length does not include its own length.
				It is the total length that follows the length value.

			<t>
				A command conforming to this specification is not
				a vendor command.
				A command created by any vendor that implements
				vendor specific commands or operations is a vendor
				command.
				Vendor commands have the VENDOR_BIT set in the
				commands or operations.
				And vendor commands MUST have a Length value
				that follows the command that indicates how
				many octets follow the length.
				This is so that implementations that do not understand
				the vendor extension can skip that many more octets
				to find the next command or operation.
			</t>
			<t>
				If any operation in a command has the VENDOR_BIT set
				it may effect implementations that do not support that
				specific vendor operation.
				So caution must be used when creating vendor command
				operation extensions.
			</t>
			<t>
				In this example the server is sending a CAPABILITY_PRE
				command telling the client that the server supports
				AUTHMD5 and some made up vendor authentication AUTH_Vendor_3.
				The AUTHMD5 does not have the VENDOR_BIT set, and
				AUTH_Vendor_e has the VENDOR_BIT set.
			</t>
			<t>
				Clients or servers that are not using vendor specific
				extensions, can:
			</t>
			<ul>
				<li>Send a VENDOR_ID with the value as an	empty string.</li>
				<li>
					Or set the string, and just do not send
					any command or command operations with extensions.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<t>
				Clients that do not understand the string value in VENDOR_ID
				would ignore the commands and capabilities with the
				VENDOR_BIT set.
				Which is AUTH_Vendor_3 in this example.
			</t>
			<t>
				<xref target="AuthPreEx1"/>
				is an example of a CAPABILITY_PRE being sent
				from the server to the client.
				A client that is conforming to this specification and
				does not support any vendor extensions, would ignore the
				AUTH_Vendor_3	and authenticate with AUTHMD5.
				NOTE: This is how the application sees the data,
				this is not the over the wire data as it is not
				in CBOR format.
			</t>
			<figure anchor="AuthPreEx1">
				<name>Packet Body Non-Vendor- Diagram</name>

          <artwork align="center" type="svg" src="Generated/Packet-01.svg"/>
				</artset>
			</figure>
			
			<t>
				In example <xref target="P01-01"/>, the server is telling the
				client that it is using a vendor specific AUTHMD5
				and a vendor specific AUTH_Vendor_e only.
			</t>
			<t>
				When when vendor specific extensions make the connection
				incompatible with implementations conforming to this
				specification, then it MUST also set the VENDOR_BIT in the command.
				In this example it is being set in the CAPABILITY_PRE command.
				A conforming client would then know that there are zero compatible
				authentication methods to this server.
				A client implementations that understand the contents of the string
				value for VENDOR_ID, may also understand these extensions.
			</t>
			<t>
				After each entry that has the VENDOR_BIT set, the next
				value must be a Length indicating how many octets of data
				follow the Length, even when zero.
			</t>

			<t>
				And the matching data for <xref target="P01-01"/> could be:

			<figure anchor="P01-02">
				<name>Packet Body Vendor - Diagram Data</name>
				<artset>
					<artwork align="center" type="ascii-art" src="Drawings/Packet-01-02.txt"/>
          <artwork align="center" type="svg" src="Generated/Packet-01-02.svg"/>
				</artset>
			</figure>
			<t>
				Note that the CAPABILITY_PRE in <xref target="P01-01"/> and <xref target="P01-02"/>
				has the VENDOR_BIT set, so it is followed by the number of octets
				in the vendor extension.
			</t>
			<t>
				Multiple commands may be sent in one packet.
				And PHOENIX and VENDOR commands may be sent
				in one packet body by setting VENDOR_BIT to (1).
				This example shows two commands and the start of a third,
				one that is a PHOENIX command	the other is a vendor command.

			All replies to a command are also a command packet.
			They contain the same command SEQ and command
			as the original packet.
			The endpoint recognizes it is a reply because:
		</t>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The	command SEQ matches one that is waiting a reply.
			</li>
			<li>
				When the client gets an even numbered SEQ, it can only
				be a reply.
			</li>
			<li>
				When the server gets an odd numbered
				SEQ, it can only be a reply.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<t>
			Some commands have zero to many replies.
			Each of these multiple replies contains the same SEQ as the
			original command. An example, the client sends a request
			to be notified when new email arrives and uses command
			SEQ 20. Each time a new email arrives, a reply will
			be sent from the server with a command SEQ of 20.
			And over time, the client may get many with a SEQ of 20
			as new emails arrive on the server.
		</t>
		<t>
			And like the original command, multiple replies may be
			in one packet.
