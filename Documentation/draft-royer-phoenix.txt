Abstract

   NOTE: This is just getting started, not ready for submission yet.

   Email and MIME messages account for one the largest volumes of data
   on the internet.  The transfer of these MIME message has not had a
   major updated in decades.  Part of the reason is that it is very
   important data and altering it takes a great deal of care and
   planning.

   This application transport can also transfer non-MIME data.  It can
   be used as an XDR transport, or for opaque data (blobs of known or
   unknown data) transport.

   Another major concern is security and authentication.  This proposal
   allows for existing authentication to continue to work.

   This is a MIME message transport that can facilitate the transfer of
   any kind of MIME message.  Including email, calendaring, and text,
   image, or multimedia MIME messages.  It can transfer multipart and
   simple MIME messages.

   The POP and IMAP protocols are overly chatty and now that the
   Internet can handle 8-bit transfers, there is no need for the overly
   complex text handling of messages.

   This proposal includes a sample implementation.  (Github - Phoenix
   (https://github.com/RiverExplorer/Phoenix)) Which also includes a
   gateway from this proposal to existing systems.  Thunderbird and
   Outlook plugins are part of the sample implementation.  A Linux,
   Windows DLL and .NET, and Android client library are part of the
   sample implementation

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   On the Internet, just about everything is a MIME object and there are
   many ways to transport MIME.  This document specifies a new
   application level MIME transport mechanism and protocol.  This
   document does not specify any new or changed MIME types.

   Transporting MIME objects is generally done in one of two ways: (1)
   Broadcasting, (2) Polling.  Both methods often require some form of
   authentication, registration, and selecting of the desired material.
   These selection processes are essentially a form of remote folder
   management.  In some cases you can only select what is provided, and
   in others you have some or a lot of control over the remote folders.

   In addition to other functions, this specification defines a remote
   and local folder management.  This remote folder management is common
   with many type of very popular protocols.  This design started by
   looking at the very popular IMAP and POP protocols.

   An additional task is transporting the perhaps very large MIME
   objects.  Some MIME objects are so large that some devices may
   default to looking at only at parts of the MIME object.  An example
   is an email message with one or more very large attachments, where
   the device may default to not download the large attachment without a
   specific request from the user.

   Some objects are transported as blocks of data with a known and fixed
   size.  These are often transported with some kind of search, get, and
   put commands.  In effect these are folder and file commands

   Other MIME objects are transported in streams of data with an
   unspecified size, such as streaming music, audio, or video.  This
   specification describes how to use existing protocols to facilitate
   the data streaming.  And again, these are folder and file commands.

   A MIME object can be a simple object, or it may contain many
   multipart sections of small to huge size.  These sections can be
   viewed as files in the containing MIME object.

   By implementing this specification application developers can use the
   techniques to manage local and remote files and folders.  Remote
   email or files are the same thing in this specification.  The
   sections of MIME object with multipart sections are viewed as files
   in the MIME object.  You can interact with the entire folder, or just
   the files within it.

   MIME objects have meta data, and they are called headers.  Files and
   folders have meta data, and they are called file attributes.  This
   specification does not mandate any meta data.  It does define some
   that may be used by implementations.  Other related specifications do
   define some meta data that is consistant with existing protocols.
   This protocol allows for a consistent transport of existing meta data
   and MIME objects.

   File and folder meta data is a complex task that can involve access
   control lists and permissions.  This specification defines a
   mechanism to transport this meta data, it does not define the meta
   data.

   And this specification provides for the ability to define both
   protocol extensions and the creating of finer control for specific
   commands that may evolve over time.

   This examples compares current folder and file manipulations to how
   it can be used in this protocol with email.

   *  You can search for file names.  You can search email for: sender,
      subject, and more.

   *  You can search for file contents.  You can search for email
      message contents.

   *  You can create, delete, and modify files.  You can create, delete,
      and modify email messages.

   *  You can create, delete, and modify folders.  You can create,
      delete, and modify email folders.

   What this specification defines:

   *  How to use existing authentication implementations or use new
      ones.

   *  This specification describes a standard way to perform file and
      folder operations that are remote to the application and agnostic
      to purpose of data being transported.

   *  Specifies a way to migrate from some existing protocols to
      Phoenix.  Provides links to sample implementations.

3.  ABNF, Notes, and Definitions

3.1.  XDR TYPE - Meaning - Informative

   The meaning of "XDR TYPE" in this specification refers to the "C"
   code API.  For every "XDR TYPE" "foo", is a "C" code API of
   "xdr_foo(...)".  The purpose of "XDR TYPE" is to guide implementors
   and is to be considered informative and not normative information.

   In some cases the "xdr_foo(...)" API is part of system libraries, and
   in other cases it is the result of processing the normative XDR
   definition files provided in this specification with the tools in the
   sample implementation or open-source XDR "rpcgen / rpcgen++"
   [rpcgenopensource] tools.  "rpcgen documentation" [rpcgendocs].

   In most cases the "XDR TYPE" is used in a ".x" XDR definition file as
   the variable type.  In some cases like "string", and "opaque", they
   must be defined as arrays.  Any other exceptions are added to the
   informative description in this specifications when needed:

                 Table 1: XDR string and opaque are arrays.

3.2.  ABNF Number of bits in value

   This specification adds some syntax to ABNF [RFC5234] to deal with
   bit width in a binary number.

   Terminals may specify a bit width.  That is the number of bits in the
   value.

   Section 2.3 of Terminal Values [RFC5234] is within this specification
   defined to be:

   b = binary / binary:width

   d = decimal / decimal:width

   x = hexadecimal / hexadecimal:width

   Where: with is the number of bits in the value.  And must be an
   unsigned integer greater than zero.

   When the left side has a width: The number of bits on the left side
   must equal the number of bits on the right side.

   The most significant values are placed to the left of lesser
   signification values in the rule:

   In this example A Header is 32-bits in size and is composed of an
   8-bit (Offset), 2-bit (Flags or F), and 22-bit (Length) value.

   Header:32 = Offset:8 Flags:2 Length:22

                                  Figure 1


   Example pseudo code for the ABNF in Figure 1 could be:

   // Header is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
   // Offset is an 8-bit unsigned integer.
   // Flags (F) is a 2-bit unsigned integer.
   // Length is a 22-bit unsigned integer
   //
   Header = (Offset << 24) | (Flags << 22) | Length;

                                  Figure 2

   The pseudo code in Figure 2 shifts the 8-bit "Offset" over 24 bits to
   the left, then shifts the 2-bit value "Flags (F)" over 22 bits, then,
   places the lower 24-bits "Length" into the results.  The result would
   be all three values into the one 32-bit result as illustrated in
   Figure 3:

     8-bits | 8-bits | 8-bits | 8-bits |
   +--------+---+----+--------+--------+

3.4.  StringRef

   This protocol references strings in existing MIME objects by octet
   offset into the MIME object.  This is is called a StringRef.  All
   strings can be referenced by using a total of 8 octets.  A StringRef
   consists of two parts:

   The StringRef does not contain the string, it is a reference an
   existing string in a MIME object.

4.  Terms and Definition used in this proposal

   The following is a list of terms with their definitions as used in
   this specification.

   AdminCmd
      A general term for any administrative command.  Administrative and
      auditing operations.  This list includes commands for authorized
      users to configure, query logs, errors, possibly user activity.

   AuthCmd
      A general term for any authentication command.  Authentication and
      authorization operations.  These operations authenticate users and
      verity their authorization access.

   Body Part ID (BPID)
      A unique ID for a MIME Object.  This is an unsigned 32-bit integer
      in network byte order that is assigned by the server and sent to
      the client on a successful folder open.  This ID persists across
      connections.  And as long as the MIME object does not get altered
      in any way, this ID is valid and persists across servers.  It is
      the offset in octets from the beginning of the message to the
      start of the body part.

      See Index.  (Section 4)

   Command (CMD)
      A specific protocol operation, or command.  They are broken down
      into, AdminCmd, AuthCmd, FileCmd, and ProtoCmd.  These are called
      a CMD or command.

   FileCmd
      A general term for any file or folder command.  This include
      creating, getting, modifying, deleting, moving, and renaming
      files.

   Folder ID (FolderID)
      A unique ID for a MIME folder.  This is an unsigned 32-bit integer
      in network byte order that is assigned by the server and sent to
      the client on a successful folder open.  This ID persists across
      connections to the same server.  Once a folder has an ID, it never
      changes on a server as described in Folders (Section 5.7).

      See Index.  (Section 4)

   Index Operation Type (IndexOP)
      Header Index Operation.  A command sent as part of a folder open
      command that tells the server which MIME headers it would like
      indexed.

      See Index.  (Section 4)

   Header Name ID (HID)

      And 8-bit unsigned integer the client has assiged to a specific
      header name.  The client and server use the ID rather than passing
      the string value back and forth in indexes and other operations.
      It is not used in the MIME object.

      See Index.  (Section 4)

   HeaderName822
      A RFC822 or MIME header name.  See Section 3.2 of [RFC0822]

   HeaderID
      An offset into a MIME object where a specific header starts.  As
      its position in a MIME object is unique, this value is also used
      as the offset to a specific header.  As long as the MIME object
      does not change in any way this HeaderID persisists across
      connections and servers.

      See Index.  (Section 4)

   Header Value ID (HVID)
      Related to Header ID.  An offset into a MIME object where a
      specific header value starts.  As the position in a MIME object is
      unique, this value is also used as the HVID to a specific header
      value.  As long as the MIME object does not change in any way this
      ID persisists across connections and servers.

      See Index.  (Section 4)

      See Header ID.  (Section 4)

   Index
      This wire protocol transmits all or part of MIME objects.  Various
      parts can be referenced by an offset into the object.  This is an
      index into the MIME objects.  A client may request an index be
      used when opening a folder.

      _Note_: None of these index values are guaranteed to persist
      across re-connections to the server, as other clients may have
      altered the contents.

   List ID (LID)
      In operations that require a list or set of data.  This LID
      uniquely identifies which list or set is in context.

   Media Type
      Each MIME object has a media type that identifies the content of
      the object.  This specification does not add, remove, or alter any
      MIME media type.  This is represented in MIME objcects as the
      "Content-Type".

   MIME
      This protocol transports MIME objects.  This specification does
      not remove or alter any MIME objects;

      TODO - this link not valid.  (Section 4)

   Offset
      Unless otherwise specified, an offset is an unsigned 32-bit
      integer in network byte order.

   Packet
      A packet is a blob of data that has a header (its length) followed
      by a Phoenix command with all of its values and parameters.
      Packets flow in both directions and asynchronously.  Commands can
      be sent while still waiting for other replies.  Each endpoint may
      send commands to the other endpoint without having to be prompted
      to send information.

   Parameter
      Most commands have values that are associated with them.  These
      values are called parameters.  For example, the create folder
      command has the name of the new folder to be created as a
      parameter.

   ProtoCmd
      A general term for all protocol commands.  This also includes
      commands that do not fall into one of the other categories
      described here in this definitions section.

   SEQ, Command Sequence, (CMDSEQ) or (SEQ)
      Each command has a unique identifier, a sequence number.  All
      replies to a command include the same sequence number as the
      original command.  In this way replies can be matched up with
      their original command.

   SSL
      For the purpose of this specification, SSL is interchangeable with
      TLS.  This document uses the term TLS.  The sample implementation
      uses both SSL and TLS because the legacy UNIX, Linux, Windows, and
      OpenSSL code uses the term SSL in cases where is it TLS.

      A way of securely transporting data over the Internet.

      See [RFC8446]

   XDR
      RFC-4506 specifies a standard and compatible way to transfer
      binary information.  This protocol uses XDR to transmit a command,
      its values and any parameters and replies.  The MIME data, the
      payload, is transported as XDR opaque, and is unmodified.

      _Note_: XDR transmits data in 32-bit chunks.  An 8-bit value is
      transmitted with the lower 8-bits valid and the upper 24 bits set
      to zero.  A 16-bit value is transmitted with the lower 16-bits
      valid and the upper 16 bits set to zero.

      So many of these protocol elements pack one or more of its
      parameters into one 32-bit value.  As defined in each section.  In
      many cases pseudo code is shown on how to pack the data and create
      the protocol element.

      See Section 3 of [RFC4506]

5.  Commands

   The endpoint that initiates the connection is called the client.  The
   endpoint that is connected to, is called the server.  The client is
   the protocol authority, and the server responds to client commands as
   configured or instructed by the client.

   This section provides an overview of the basic commands.  Each
   command has a detailed section in this specification.

   When a command is sent to the remote endpoint and received, the
   remote endpoint determines if the connection is authenticated or
   authorized to perform the command.  If not supported, or not
   authorized, a NotSupported command is send as a reply.  The
   NotSupported command sent back has the same Sequence number that was
   in the original command.

   Many commands are only valid after authentication.

   When the client connects to a server it immediately sends its pre
   authentication capabilities to the server.  Or an Auth command.

   When the server gets a new connection followed by a pre
   authentication capability command, it immediately sends its pre
   authentication capabilities to the client.

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again        February 2025


   When the client and server have had a relationship, the client may
   send an Auth Command to initiate the authorization and does not send
   its pre authentication capability list to the server.  It then waits
   for the Auth reply from the server.

   *  If the client gets an Auth reply that is positive, it sends its
      post authentication capability list to the server.

   *  If the client gets an Auth reply that is negative, it sends its
      pre authentication capability list to the server.

   When a servers first received packet is a Auth command, It processes
   the Auth command and sends the Auth reply.

   *  If the Auth reply is positive, then it also sends it post
      authentication capability list.

   *  If the Auth reply is negative, then it sends its pre
      authentication capability list to the client.

   A server may automatically send its pre authentication capability
   list to the client upon initial connection.  Or it may wait to see if
   it gets a pre authentication capability list, or an Auth command.

   If the client sends an Auth command as its first packet, it may get
   the pre authentication capability from the server before the Auth
   reply.  Simply process both.

5.1.  Commands Overview - Packet and Reply

   In addition to the protocols listed in this specification.
   Additional protocols and commands can be added in the future.  They
   must follow the same framework listed here.

   This protocol connects two endpoints over a network and facilitates
   the secure and authorized transfer of MIME objects.

   This is a binary protocol.  The payload can be anything, text or
   binary.  This protocol was designed to reduce the number of back and
   forth requests and replies between the client and server.  By using
   XDR as the format for transferring binary control information it is
   portable to any computer architecture.  Appendix XXX has the rpcgen
   definition for the protocol defined in this specification.

   After the connection is successful and authenticated, ether endpoint
   may send commands to the other endpoint.  When the server initiates
   an unsolicited command, it could be a any kind of notification or
   message for the client side application or the user.  It could be
   reporting errors or updates to previous client initiated commands.

   All commands initiated from the client have even numbered command
   sequence numbers.  All commands initiated from the server have odd
   numbered command sequence numbers.

   Some commands expect a command reply.  Other commands do not expect a
   command reply.  An example of a command that expects a reply is the
   ping command.  An example of a command that does not expect a reply
   is the keep-alive command.  Conceptually there are two kinds of
   commands:

   Directive commands:  A directive type command expects the other
      endpoint to process the command and possibly reply with some
      results.  An example could be: Send me an index of my emails in my
      InBox.  The client would expect a result.  Another example is a
      bye command, once sent, no reply is expected.

   Request commands:  A request type command may or might not have any
      reply.  For example, a keep-alive command is a request to not
      timeout and has no reply.  And a send new email notifications
      command would expect zero or more replies and it would not require
      them, as they might not happen.

   These are not specific protocol entities, these concepts will be used
   to describe the expected behavior when one of these are transmitted.

5.1.1.  Packet Overview

   All commands are sent in a packet.  A packet has two parts:

   1.  The packet header.

   2.  The packet body.

5.1.1.1.  Packet Header

   The packet header has one value, the total length of the packet body,
   and payload sent as an unsigned 64-bit integer in network byte order.
   The length does not include its own length.  It is the total length
   that follows the length value.

5.1.2.  Packet Reply Overview

   All replies to a command are also a command packet.  They contain the
   same command SEQ and command as the original packet.  The endpoint
   recognizes it is a reply because:

   *  The command SEQ matches one that is waiting a reply.

   *  When the client gets an even numbered SEQ, it can only be a reply.

   *  When the server gets an odd numbered SEQ, it can only be a reply.

   Some commands have zero to many replies.  Each of these multiple
   replies contains the same SEQ as the original command.  An example,
   the client sends a request to be notified when new email arrives and

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again        February 2025


   uses command SEQ 20.  Each time a new email arrives, a reply will be
   sent from the server with a command SEQ of 20.  And over time, the
   client may get many with a SEQ of 20 as new emails arrive on the
   server.

5.2.  Administration Commands

   Implementations are not required to implement any ADMIN command.  A
   client will know the server supports one or more ADMIN commands when
   it gets its post authentication capability command from the server.

   Administrative command can be used to configure, audit, and manage
   the remote endpoint.  Administrative command can be used to
   configure, audit, and manage user access for the server
   implementation.

5.2.1.  Administration Capability Definitions

   Implementations MUST NOT send the ADMIN capability in the pre
   authorization CAPABILITY list.

   Implementations that support any administration command MAY include
   ADMIN capability in the post authentication CAPABILITY list.  An
   implementation may decide that only specified and authorized users
   may issue administrative commands and send only those authenticated
   users the ADMIN capability.

   The ADMIN capability includes the list of ADMIN commands the user is
   allowed to perform.  For example, if a user only has permission to
   only view user lists, then only the USER_LIST ADMIN capability will
   be provided.

   The capability name is also the command name to use when invoking
   that capability.

   When a user attempts to send a commmand they are not authorized to
   send, the remote endpoint will reply with a NotSupported command with
   its sequence number set to the sequence number from offending
   command.

5.2.2.  Administration Operations

   To simplify naming, the capability names and command/reply names are
   the same.

   The following operations are defined for administration.  Each is
   part of an ADMIN command or ADMIN reply.  They each have a unique
   identifier, and ADMIN Operation ID (AOID).

5.2.2.3.  Administration - SERVER_CONFIGURE (0x00:8)

   Remote administration of servers is an essential feature in modern
   systems.  An implementation that supports SERVER_CONFIGURE adds
   SERVER_CONFIGURE to the post authentication capability command sent
   from the server to the client.  The server implementation only sends
   this capability to authenticated and authorized users.  Users can
   become authorized with the USER_PERMISSIONS command, or by server
   implementation specific configuration methods.  Server specific
   configuration methods are out of scope for this specification.

   Server specific configuration options are unique to each server
   implementation.  This specification defines a method to set, update,
   delete, and view server configuration values.

   It is suggested that client implementations send a post
   authentication implementation specific capability to authenticated
   and authorized users in order to identify themselves to their own
   server implementations.  If the client does not send the correnct
   vendor ID information, then the server would not send its
   SERVER_CONFIGURE capability to the client.

   SERVER_CONFIGURE sends and receives the configuration information in
   key + value pairs.  The key and value are each a string.

   This specification does not define any configuration information.  It
   provides a common way to set, get, update, and delete them.

   Multiple SERVER_CONFIGURE commands can be sent in the same ADMIN
   packet.

   There can be only one user per connection.  So the USER_KICK_USER
   ADMIN command has no data associated with it.  When this ADMIN CMD is

   Get information from the server about its implementation logs.  All

   A SERVER_LOGS ADMIN CMD can be sent with no information, this causes
   the server to send all of the information for the last 24 hours.

5.8.  KeepAlive Command Summary

   The KeepAlive command is sent to the server from the client.  It
   requests the server not time out.  The server may honor or ignore the
   request.

   The Phoenix protocol is designed to transfer data and a server may
   handle a small subsets of what is possible.  Which is why the server
   decides what is an important command while determining idle timeout.

   When the server sends the post authentication capabilities to the
   client, it includes an IdleTimeout capability that includes the
   number of seconds it allows for idle time.  If no significant action
   has been taken by the client, as determined by the server, in that
   time the server may timeout and close the connection.

   The KeepAlive command tells the server that the client wishes the
   server not to time out as long as a KeepAlive or other command is
   sent to the server before IdleTimeout seconds have passed.

   An IdleTimeout capability can be a positive number, zero, or a
   negative number.

   *  A positive number is the maximum idle time in seconds before the
      server terminates the connection.

   *  When the IdleTimeout is zero (0), the server does not timeout.

   *  When the IdleTimeout is less than zero (< 0), it means it ignores
      KeepAlive and it will idle out in the absolute value of the
      IdleTimeout value in seconds.  For example, a value of (-300)
      means it will ignore KeepAlive and timeout when the server
      determines nothing significant has happened in 5 minutes (300
      seconds).

   Servers that are not threaded or can not reply to simultaneous or
   overlapping commands, MUST set their IdleTimeout to zero (0) or a
   negative number.

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again        February 2025


   Clients MUST NOT send KeepAlive commands to a server that has an
   IdleTimeout of zero (0) or negative (< 0).

   Clients MUST NOT send KeepAlive commands to the server until at least
   75% of the idle time has passed since the last command has been sent
   to the server.

   A server may terminate a connection if the server implementation
   determines that KeepAlive commands are arriving to quickly.

5.9.  Ping Command Summary

   The ping command is only sent when the client implementation has
   determined it has waited too long for a command reply.  The ping
   command is only initiated from the client.  It is not valid for the
   server to send a ping command to a client.

   The ping command MUST NOT be the first command sent to the server.
   It should only be sent when the client implementation determines it
   has waited too long for a reply.

   If the server supports the ping command, then a PING capability is
   sent in the pre authentication capability command.

   Sometimes servers are unavailable and can go down.  A server could be
   down for maintenance, or in a shutdown mode.  It might limit the
   number of simultaneous connections.  It might be very busy.  The
   packets might not be making it to the server because of network
   issues.

   When a ping command is received by the server:

   *  When the server did not send PING capability in the post
      authentication capability list to the client.  Then the server
      replies with a NotSupported packet with the sequence number the
      same as in the ping command.

   *  When the server has not yet received an authentication command,
      the server replies with a NotSupported packet with the sequence
      number the same as in the ping command.

   *  When the server has received an authentication command, and has
      not yet replied to an authentication command.  Then the server
      sends a ping reply, with the same sequence number that was in the
      ping command.  This could happen when the client implementation
      had determined it has waited too long for an authentication reply.

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again        February 2025


   *  When the client is authenticated, and when the server is available
      for processing commands.  Then the server replies with a ping
      reply with the same sequence number.  This could happen when the
      client implementation had determined it has waited too long for an
      expected reply.

   If the server is alive and not available, the server will reply with
   a NotSupported command, with its sequence number set to the sequence
   number in the ping command.

   If a connected and authenticated client has been waiting for a reply
   or for some other reason needs to determine if the server is still
   available.  It can send a ping command.  If the server is still
   available, it sends a ping reply.  If it is no longer available for
   any reason, it sends a NotSupported reply.

   A client MUST NOT send a ping command if it is waiting the results of
   a previously sent ping command.

   A client MUST NOT send a ping command more frequently than 90% of the
   server timeout.

   Clients and servers must give priority to ping commands.  If
   possible, reply as soon as it receives the command.

   The server MAY consider too many ping commands as a malfunctioning or
   malicious client and terminate the connection.

   Servers that are not threaded or can not reply to simultaneous or
   overlapping commands, MUST NOT include PING in their post
   authentication capability command.

6.  Meta Data with Shared Objects

   When a server implementation allows shared objects, the meta data
   returned to the client may be different depending on the
   authenticated user.  Some users may have read only copies, other may
   be able to delete the object.

   When a shared object is deleted, it is marked as deleted for only the
   user that issued the delete.

   When a shared object is expunged, its access is removed for the user
   that issued the expunge.  After all users have expunged the object,
   then it is removed by the server.

   There are two kinds of expunge for shared objects.  Forced and
   Delayed.

   Server implementations must reject attempts to fetch or view a folder
   or file or any of its meta data when an expunge has started, and not
   yet completed.

   *  Forced:

      A forced expunge can be the result of security policies at the
      server, site, or administrators discretion.  This also is how
      timed messages are deleted.

      In order for a shared object that is expunged to not force an
      immediate re-index for all clients, when the server gets a forced
      expunge, the server sends an expunge to all clients, where the
      client MUST immediately make the object not show to the user and
      MUST invalidate any file, cached, or memory copy of the data the
      client has control over.  Then when convenient, the client can do
      a re-index of the folder.  When a user is viewing the object when
      an expunge arrives, the client must inform the user that the data
      is no longer available and replace the user view of the data with
      an empty object or move the view to another object.

      Server implementations must prioritize forced expunge notices to
      the clients and immediately reject all attempts to read, view,
      copy, or access meta data.

   *  Delayed:

      The user is informed the MIME object is no longer available.  The
      client implementation may continue to show the object.  The client
      may copy the MIME object, unless tagged as NoCopy.

      The next time the client does an expunge the object will be
      expunged from the client.

      When a client application closes, all delayed expunges MUST occur
      at exit.

      When a client applications starts the client MUST check for
      delayed expunges that have not been processed and expunge them and
      not allow the user to see them.

7.  Meta Data

   In this specification a file and a MIME object are used
   interchangeably.  Meta Data is data that is associated with the MIME
   object and not contained within the MIME object.  Meta Data should
   never be stored in the MIME object as altering the MIME object would
   invalidate the index information and can invalidate digital signature
   and encryption information.

   Meta Data for the folder and MIME objects is returned in a
   FOLDER_OPEN, FILE_OPEN, FILE_METADATA, or FOLDER_METADATA command.
   Meta Data can be set and updated by the client using FILE_METADATA or
   FOLDER_METADATA commands.

   Most are 8-bit boolean values that are set to false (0x00) or true
   (0x01).  A value that does not exists is the same as a false.

   Meta data can be global to the object.  That is once tagged (or not
   tagged) the attribute shows up for all users.  Or it can be user
   specific meta data.  User specific meta data does not show up for
   other users.

   Many have the same or similar name and meaning as they do in IMAP
   [RFC9051].

7.1.  Meta Data - Answered

   This Meta Data only applies to files.

   When true, the object has been replied to by the client.  This has
   the same meaning as \Answered does in IMAP.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.2.  Meta Data - Attributes

   This object has been tagged with special attributes.  It is a list of
   strings with matching values.

   User defined attributes MUST start with "X-".  These are not portable
   between implementations and no attempt should be made to copy these
   between implementations.

   Non user defined attributes are described in other sections or
   specifications.

   This can be user specific meta data or global meta data.  See the
   specific attribute documentation.

7.3.  Meta Data - Deleted

   When true, this object has been marked as deleted and has not yet
   been expunged.  This has the same meaning as \Deleted does in IMAP.

   For shared objects, an expunge removes the user from shared access to
   the file.  And the actual expunge is only processed when all shared
   users have expunged the object.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.4.  Meta Data - Draft

   This Meta Data only applies to files.

   When true, this object is incomplete and not ready.

   This has the same meaning as \Draft does in IMAP.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data.

7.5.  Meta Data - Flagged

   An object has been tagged as important.  This is the same as the IMAP
   \Flagged value.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.6.  Meta Data - Forwarded

   This Meta Data only applies to files.

   This has the same meaning as $Forwarded does in IMAP.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.7.  Meta Data - Hide

   With NotExpungable objects, the user may wish to not view the object.
   In these cases the attribute Hide can be set.  The attribute does not
   effect the view of other users.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.8.  Meta Data - Junk

   This has the same meaning as $Junk does in IMAP.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.9.  Meta Data - MDNSent

   This Meta Data only applies to files.

   This value can be set and unset.  This has the same meaning as
   $MDNSent does in IMAP.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.10.  Meta Data - NoCopy

   When true, this MIME object can not be copied.

   This value can be set and unset by the owner of the file or folder.
   This value can not be unset by non owners.  This is global meta data.

7.11.  Meta Data - NotJunk

   This has the same meaning as $NotJunk does in IMAP.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.12.  Meta Data - NotExpungable

   The mime object can not be marked for delete or expunged.  It could
   be because it is an historical record that will never be expunged, or
   other reason.

   A client implementation could use the Hide attribute to not show the
   object to the user.

   This value can be set and unset by the owner of the file or folder.
   This value can not be unset by non owners.  This is global meta data.

7.13.  Meta Data - Phishing

   This has the same meaning as $Phishing does in IMAP.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.14.  Meta Data - ReadOnly

   The MIME object associated with this attribute can not be altered,
   deleted, moved, or renamed.  It can be copied, unless the NoCopy meta
   tag is also applied.

   This value can be set and unset by the owner of the file or folder.
   This value can not be unset by non owners.  This is global meta data.

   Setting of this to false may fail if the file or folder is stored on
   read-only media.  When the file or folder is stored on read-only
   media, this MUST BE set to true.

7.15.  Meta Data - Shared

   The MIME object associated with this attribute is shared and is also
   often tagged with the ReadOnly meta data tag.

   This value can not be set and unset by the owner.

   If copying of the file or folder is allowed, then the shared
   attribute is removed when copied.

   This file or folder will only be expunged when all of the users with
   shared access have deleted and expunged it.

7.16.  Meta Data - Seen

   This has the same meaning as \Seen does in IMAP.

   This value can be set and unset.  This is user specific meta data
   because it also applies to shared folders and files.

7.17.  Meta Data - MDNData Attribute

   This Meta Data Attribute is only visible to the owner of the object
   for which MDN has been set.

   This is a list of recipients email address that that are on the
   distribution list effected by the MDN.

8.  Index

8.1.  Interested Headers

   Some implementation may wish to specify which MIME headers it wants
   to get in the index supplied by the server.  This is done as part of
   the folder selection command which can supply a list of desired
   headers.  Or it can specify a list ID that has already been
   transmitted.  When none are supplied, no header index values will be
   returned.

   This list can be the same for all folders, or unique to specific
   folders.  The client generates a list of interested headers and sends
   an Interested Headers list or list ID to the server when selecting a
   folder.

8.1.1.  List ID (LID)

   A List ID (LID) is a unsigned integer ranging from 0 to 254.  It is
   used in requests and replies to refer to the interested headers list.
   A client can have up to 254 (LID 0 to 254) lists per connection.  The
   value 255 is reserved for expansion.

   Restrictions:

   *  The list IDs are unique to the connection and do not persist
      across connections.

   *  No two lists can have the same ID within a connection.

   ABNF:

   LID    = uint8_t;

8.1.2.  Index Operation (IndexOP)

   An Index Operation (IndexOP) has only one of two values:

   *  IndexOPDefine = 0

      Used to define a list of body MIME object, and Body Part,
      interesting headers the client cares about.  When the LID is
      already defined, then this redefines it.  When the LID is not
      already defined, it creates a new list.  The results will come
      back as an Folder-Index in a successful FOLDER_OPEN reply.

Internet-Draft        Phoenix: Lemonade Risen Again        February 2025


   *  IndexOPUse = 1

      This indicates that LID is an existing list number to use.  LID
      has previously been defined in this session.  The results will
      come back as an Folder-Index in a successful FOLDER_OPEN reply.

   ABNF:

   IndexOpDefine   = 0x00:8

   IndexOpUse      = 0x01:8

   IndexOp         = IndexOpDefine / IndexOpUse

8.1.3.  Header ID (HID)

   A Header ID (HID) is an unsigned integer ranging from 0 to 254.  The
   client assigned the HID value to a header name, then the client and
   server references it by HID in packets and replies.  A client can
   have up to 254 interested headers per connection.  The value 255 is
   reserved for expansion.

   ABNF:

   HID    = uint8_t;

8.1.4.  Lists

   The client sends a list to the server as part of a FOLDER_OPEN.  One
   of the parameters to a FOLDER_OPEN is an interested header list.  A
   successfule reply to a FOLDER_OPEN will include indexes into the MIME
   object for the desired header values.

   The list can be defined in the same packet.  Or it can use an already
   defined list.  Or it can not request any header indexes by defining
   or using a list that has zero entries.

   Figure 23, shows the interisted header list prefix.  This interisted
   header list prefix is followed by zero or more SingleEntry objects.

      The first 8-bits are zero.

      The IndexOP of zero, which means defining a list.

      And in this example two (0x02) MIME object headers are requested
      to be indexed, "From", and "Subject".

   *  (b): A 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order as described
      in Figure 24.

      The header ID that the client and server will use to to identify
      the "From" header name will be zero (0) in this example.

      The length of the string "From" is four (4) and its length is the
      lower 24 bits of this entry.

   *  (c) A series of 8-bit unsigned values packed into one or more
      32-bit unsigned integers in network byte order.

      Each 8-bit value is the value of the letters in "From".  As "From"
      is a multiple of 32-bits, no padding is done.

   *  (d): A 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order as described
      in Figure 24.

      The header ID that the client and server will use to to identify
      the "Subject" header name will be one (1) in this example.

      The length of the string "Subject" is seven (7) and its length is
      the lower 24 bits of this entry.

   *  (e) A series of 8-bit unsigned values packed into one or more
      32-bit unsigned integers in network byte order.

      Each 8-bit value is the value of the letters in "Subject".

      As The length of "Subject" is not a multiple of 32-bits, the
      remaining bits are ignored.  Shown as zero in this example.

   *  (f) The two MIME objects headers are done, start of Body Part
      headers, and there is one (1) of them.  IndexOP and LID are not
      used here.

   *  (g) The second header will be identified as three (3).  The first
      body part header is 12 octets long (0xc): 'Content-Type'.

   *  (h) The value of the characters for 'Content-Type'.

8.2.  MIME Folder Index

   In this specification, a MIME folder is also called a folder.  And
   can be files containing MIME objects on a disk that have a defined
   order, or sequence of MIME objects in one file.

   A folder index is a summary of the contents of a MIME folder.  It may
   include the basic header information.  It does include location
   information provided as the octet count to the start of the beginning
   of the related target data.

   *  An index is an unsigned 32-bit integer in network byte order.

   *  A length is an unsigned 32-bit integer in network byte order.

   For example, if a MIME folder contains 100 MIME messages, then the
   folder index will have 100 message indexes.  Each message will have
   header indexes for the interested headers.  Each message index will
   contain 1 or more body part indexes.  Each body part will have header
   indexes with zero (0) or more entries.

8.2.1.  Folder Index Header

   A folder index consists of:

   *  The entire length of the index as a 32-bit unsigned integer in
      network byte order of what follows this value.  Allowing the
      recipient of this index to do one read and process later.

   *  The number of message indexes in this folder index.  As an
      unsigned 32-bit integer in network byte order.

   The index header is 8 octets, that is followed by the each message
   index:

   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
   |  32-bit Total Folder Index Size   |
   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
   |  32-bit Message Indexes Count     |

  FolderIndexHeader = FolderIndexSize:32 MessageCount:32 ArrayOfMsgIndex

   The header is followed by an array of message indexes.  They are an
   ordered list of references to each message.  In the order they appear
   in the folder:

8.2.2.  Message Index

   *  A 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order that is the offset
      into the folder of the message.  A Message offset is unique in a
      MIME folder, it is used both as an offset into the MIME folder,
      and as a unique ID within a MIME folder for a message.

   *  An a length of the message as a 32-bit unsigned integer in network
      byte order.

   For each message index is an ordered list of interested headers.  The
   interested header list is assignable by the client and body part
   indexes.  It consists of offsets to the interested headers and
   associated value.  Each interested header can be indexed with nine
   (9) octets.  and consists of:

8.2.3.  Header Index

   *  ID-CNT: A count of matched headers.  Only matched headers will be
      included.  If they are not included, no such header existed in the
      object.

   *  The number of body parts in this object.  An unsigned 8-bit
      number.  With MIME, body parts may contain body parts.

      Any MIME preamble and epilogue are not counted as body parts A
      preamble, if it exists, can be easily be calculated as it starts
      as the first octet after the header area.  And the epilogue, if it
      exists, can be calculated as starting as the first octet after the
      last MIME boundary.

   *  Followed by an array of ID-CNT 8-bit client assigned HID values
      that matched.  Padded to round up to 32-bits.  The unused bits are
      ignored and shown as zero in this specification.

   A single header index consists of the list description, followed by
   the index values.  There are two header indexes in each Message
   index.

   1.  The first is for the MIME object itself.

   2.  The second is for the objects Body Parts.  This part will not
       exists exist when it is an RFC-822 style message or has no body
       parts.  Followed by the header index.  This second part also
       include an offset to the start of the body part itself in the
       MIME object.

   A list description is one 8-bit result count, followed by the list of
   matching header ID's (HID).

   If the list description is not a multiple of 32-bits then padding is
   added and the extra are ignored and shown as zero in this
   specification.

8.2.4.  Header Index Example 1

   For example, if the client requested MIME object indexes for the
   "From", "Subject", "To", "Message-ID", "Content-Type", "MIME-
   Version", and "Date" header values.

   Assume this is an RFC-822 message with no body parts.  So the body
   part header index has a count of zero (0).  And the HID values
   assigned by the client when opening the folder are:

   *  From: 0

   *  Subject: 1

   *  To: 2

   *  Message-ID: 3

   *  Content-Type: 4

   *  Data: 5

   *  MIME-Version: 6

Appendix A.  Administrative Enumerated Binary Values

   Phoenix is a binary protocol.  Each value is sent as an unsigned
   32-bit integer in xdr format.

   The values for the commands are arbitrary and were assigned as
   created.  There is no plan or origination to the numbers.  There is
   no priority or superiority to any value.  The table is sorted by
   name, not value.

   The values are not unique.  They are only unique within the context
   in which they are used.

   Some of these values are reused for other commands.  For example
   USER_CREATE is both an (a) AUTH capability reply informing the user
   that they have permission to create a user with the (b) USER_CREATE
   command.

   Some values may be reused if they are parameter arguments to other
   commands.  For example xxxxxx.
